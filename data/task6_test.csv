13328,"To understand this , we need a working definition of force .",0
13329,"Our intuitive definition of force — that is , a push or a pull — is a good place to start .",0
13330,"We know that a push or pull has both magnitude and direction ( therefore , it is a vector quantity ) and can vary considerably in each regard .",0
13331,"Force is a push or pull that can be defined in terms of various standards , and it is a vector having both magnitude and direction .",1
13332,Newton ’s second law of motion is closely related to Newton ’s first law of motion .,0
13333,It mathematically states the cause and effect relationship between force and changes in motion .,1
13334,These will be discussed in more detail in later sections .,0
13335,"For now , we will define friction as a force that opposes the motion past each other of objects that are touching .",1
13336,"[ link](b ) shows how vectors representing the external forces add together to produce a net force ,",0
13337,"This means the rocket exerts a large backward force on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber , and the gas therefore exerts a large reaction force forward on the rocket .",1

13352,"Physics is concerned with describing the interactions of energy , matter , space , and time , and it is especially interested in what fundamental mechanisms underlie every phenomenon .",1
13353,"The concern for describing the basic phenomena in nature essentially defines the realm of physics . Physics aims to describe the function of everything around us , from the movement of tiny charged particles to the motion of people , cars , and spaceships .",0
13354,"The kinetic theory of gases , on the other hand , is a model in which a gas is viewed as being composed of atoms and molecules .",1
13355,"Atoms and molecules are too small to be observed directly with our senses — thus , we picture them mentally to understand what our instruments tell us about the behavior of gases . A law uses concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments .",1
13356,"Often , a law can be expressed in the form of a single mathematical equation .",0
13357,"Modern physics itself consists of the two revolutionary theories , relativity and quantum mechanics .",0

13368,How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division ?,0
13369,"If the measurements going into the calculation have small uncertainties ( a few percent or less ) , then the method of adding percents can be used for multiplication or division .",0
13370,This method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation .,0
13371,"An understanding of acceleration , for example , is crucial to the study of force .",0
13372,Our formal study of physics begins with kinematics which is defined as the study of motion without considering its causes .,1

13388,"The quantities that might differ between them are volume and density . Section SummaryNewton ’s first law of motion states that a body at rest remains at rest , or , if in motion , remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force .",1
13389,This is also known as the law of inertia .,0
13390,"As we will see , the basic forces are all thought to act through the exchange of microscopic carrier particles , and the characteristics of the basic forces are determined by the types of particles exchanged .",0
13391,"Action at a distance , such as the gravitational force of Earth on the Moon , is explained by the existence of a force field rather than by “ physical contact . ”",0
13392,Friction is a force that is around us all the time that opposes relative motion between systems in contact but also allows us to move ( which you have discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice ) .,1
13393,"While a common force , the behavior of friction is actually very complicated and is still not completely understood .",0

13403,Energy is characterized by its many forms and the fact that it is conserved .,0
13404,"We can loosely define energy as the ability to do work , admitting that in some circumstances not all energy is available to do work .",1
13405,"Because of the association of energy with work , we begin the chapter with a discussion of work .",0
13406,"This expression is called the work - energy theorem , and it actually applies in general ( even for forces that vary in direction and magnitude ) , although we have derived it for the special case of a constant force parallel to the displacement .",0

13422,"The importance of momentum , unlike the importance of energy , was recognized early in the development of classical physics .",0
13423,Momentum was deemed so important that it was called the “ quantity of motion . ” Newton actually stated his second law of motion in terms of momentum : The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes .,1

13429,But the internal kinetic energy is zero after the collision .,0
13430,A collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes called a perfectly inelastic collision because it reduces internal kinetic energy more than does any other type of inelastic collision .,1

13560,Spectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption .,0
13561,"t is at this step in the reaction center , this step in photosynthesis , that light energy is converted into an excited electron .",0
13562,"All of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long - term storage in the form of a carbohydrate . PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain , which also includes the cytochrome complex .",0
13563,"The cytochrome complex , an enzyme composed of two protein complexes , transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone ( Pq ) to the protein plastocyanin ( Pc ) , thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI .",1
13564,hese reactions actually have several names associated with them .,0
13565,"Another term , the Calvin cycle , is named for the man who discovered it , and because these reactions function as a cycle .",0
13566,Others call it the Calvin - Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery .,0
13567,here are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells .,0
13568,"Communication between cells is called intercellular signaling , and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling .",1
13569,"An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes : inter- means """" between """" ( for example , intersecting lines are those that cross each other ) and intra- means """" inside """" ( like intravenous).Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands .",0
13570,igands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules .,0
13571,"Ligands interact with proteins in target cells , which are cells that are affected by chemical signals ; these proteins are also called receptors .",1
13572,"Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties ; however , a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand .",0
13573,ignals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast - moving electrical impulses .,0
13574,"When these impulses reach the end of the axon , the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell ( the cell emitting the signal ) .",1
13575,"The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells , which are called chemical synapses ( [ link ] ) .",1
13576,utocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released .,1
13577,"This means the signaling cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell ( the prefix auto- means self , a reminder that the signaling cell sends a signal to itself ) .",0
13578,"ell - surface receptors , also known as transmembrane receptors , are cell surface , membrane - anchored ( integral ) proteins that bind to external ligand molecules .",1
13579,"This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction , in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intercellular signal .",1
13580, - protein - linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G - protein .,1
13581,The activated G - protein then interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane ( [ link ] ) .,0
13582,onformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins .,0
13583,"In some cases , binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor , which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer .",1
13584,A dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules ( often identical ) join together .,1
13585,his variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types .,0
13586,"Another complicating element is signal integration of the pathways , in which signals from two or more different cell - surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell .",1
13587,This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response .,0
13588,"he response to the increase in Ca2 + varies , depending on the cell type involved .",0
13589,"For example , in the β - cells of the pancreas , Ca2 + signaling leads to the release of insulin , and in muscle cells , an increase in Ca2 + leads to muscle contractions . Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) .",1

13591,he enzyme phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to form diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol triphosphate ( IP3 ) ( [ link ] ) .,0
13592,These products of the cleavage of PIP2 serve as second messengers .,0
13593,"hen a cell is damaged , superfluous , or potentially dangerous to an organism , a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger programmed cell death , or apoptosis .",1
13594,Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell .,0
13595,"udding yeasts ( [ link ] ) are able to participate in a process that is similar to sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells ( cells with one - half the normal number of chromosomes ) combining to form a diploid cell ( a cell with two sets of each chromosome , which is what normal body cells contain ) .",1
13596,"In order to find another haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate , budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor .",0
13597,"When mating factor binds to cell - surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby , they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling cascade that includes protein kinases and GTP - binding proteins that are similar to G - proteins .",0
13598,he continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle .,0
13599,The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell ’s life from the division of a single parent cell to the production of two new daughter cells .,1
13600,The mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated .,0
13601,"uman body cells have 46 chromosomes , while human gametes ( sperm or eggs ) have 23 chromosomes each .",0
13602,"A typical body cell , or somatic cell , contains two matched sets of chromosomes , a configuration known as diploid .",1
13603,"The letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes ; therefore , a diploid organism is designated 2n .",0
13604,atched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous ( “ same knowledge ” ) chromosomes .,1
13605,"Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location , or locus .",0
13606,"Genes , the functional units of chromosomes , determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins .",1
13607,NA replicates in the S phase of interphase .,0
13608,"After replication , the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids .",0
13609,"When fully compact , the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins .",0
13610,"hroughout interphase , nuclear DNA remains in a semi - condensed chromatin configuration .",0
13611,"In the S phase , DNA replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules — sister chromatids — that are firmly attached to the centromeric region .",1
13612,The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase .,0
13613,"n the G2 phase , the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation .",1
13614,"Some cell organelles are duplicated , and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase .",0
13615,"uring prophase , the “ first phase , ” the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate into small vesicles , and the membranous organelles ( such as the Golgi complex or Golgi apparatus , and endoplasmic reticulum ) , fragment and disperse toward the periphery of the cell .",1
13616,The nucleolus disappears ( disperses ) .,0
13617,hromosomes become more condensed and discrete .,0
13618,Each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the centromeric region ( [ link ] ) .,1
13619,The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules .,0
13620,"uring telophase , the “ distance phase , ” the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense ( unravel ) , relaxing into a chromatin configuration .",1
13621,The mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell .,0
13622,"uring telophase , these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast ( a vesicular structure ) at the metaphase plate .",0
13623,"There , the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls ; this structure is called a cell plate .",1
13624,"As more vesicles fuse , the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell .",0
13625,he genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto - oncogenes .,1
13626,"Proto - oncogenes are normal genes that , when mutated in certain ways , become oncogenes , genes that cause a cell to become cancerous .",1
13627,aryokinesis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell .,1
13628,This type of cell division is called binary ( prokaryotic ) fission . Binary Fission,0
13629,ormation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site .,0
13630,"A septum is formed between the nucleoids , extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell .",0
13631,"When the new cell walls are in place , the daughter cells separate .",0
13632,"aploid cells , containing a single copy of each homologous chromosome , are found only within structures that give rise to either gametes or spores .",0
13633,Spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell .,1
13634,"All animals and most plants produce eggs and sperm , or gametes .",0
13635,"he synaptonemal complex , a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes , first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes .",1
13636,The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis .,1
13637,"In synapsis , the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other .",0
13638,ocated at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules .,1
13639,These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover — or genetic recombination — between the non - sister chromatids .,0
13640,"Near the recombination nodule on each chromatid , the double - stranded DNA is cleaved , the cut ends are modified , and a new connection is made between the non - sister chromatids .",0
13641,"hen the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another , the ploidy level — the number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus — has been reduced from two to one .",1
13642,"For this reason , meiosis I is referred to as a reduction division .",0
13643,There is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis .,0
13644,early all animals employ a diploid - dominant life - cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes .,1
13645,"Early in the development of the embryo , specialized diploid cells , called germ cells , are produced within the gonads , such as the testes and ovaries .",1
13646,Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes .,0
13647,"upported by the monastery , he taught physics , botany , and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels .",0
13648,"In 1856 , he began a decade - long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants , ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system ( a system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems ) .",1
13649,"In 1865 , Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local Natural History Society .",0
13650,endel was the first researcher to see it .,0
13651,"Instead of continuous characteristics , Mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes ( specifically , violet versus white flowers ) ; this is referred to as discontinuous variation .",1
13652,"Mendel ’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring , nor were they absorbed , but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on .",0
13653,endel collected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season .,1
13654,"These offspring were called the F1 , or the first filial ( filial = offspring , daughter or son ) , generation .",0
13655,"Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants , he allowed them to self - fertilize naturally .",0
13656,"hen Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa , he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent , male or female , contributed which trait .",0
13657,This is called a reciprocal cross — a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross .,1
13658,"For the other six characteristics Mendel examined , the F1 and F2 generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color .",0
13659,he product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics .,0
13660,The product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone .,1
13661,wo alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics .,0
13662,The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype .,1
13663,"An organism ’s underlying genetic makeup , consisting of both physically visible and non - expressed alleles , is called its genotype .",1
13664,endel ’s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait .,0
13665,"When P1 plants with contrasting traits were cross - fertilized , all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait , meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined .",0
13666,"eyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents , Mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote .",1
13667,"Called the test cross , this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders .",0
13668,"In a test cross , the dominant - expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic .",0
13669," variation on incomplete dominance is codominance , in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote .",1
13670,An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans .,0
13671,he sex chromosomes are one pair of non - homologous chromosomes .,0
13672,"Until now , we have only considered inheritance patterns among non - sex chromosomes , or autosomes .",0
13673,"In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes , human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes , whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair .",1
13674,"ecause the gene is essential , these individuals might fail to develop past fertilization , die in utero , or die later in life , depending on what life stage requires this gene .",0
13675,"An inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some altered non - lethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal . For crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous , only wild - type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed .",1
13676,The genotypic ratio would therefore be 2:1 .,0
13677,"bserving that true - breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F1 generations that all expressed the dominant trait and F2 generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio , Mendel proposed the law of segregation .",0
13678,This law states that paired unit factors ( genes ) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor .,1
13679,"owever , each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes , organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string .",0
13680,"The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage , in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair .",1
13681,"However , because of the process of recombination , or “ crossover , ” it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently , or as if they are not linked .",0
13682,"t is now known that the pairing and interaction between homologous chromosomes , known as synapsis , does more than simply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter cells .",1
13683,"When synapsed , homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in a process called homologous recombination , or more simply , “ crossing over . ”",1
13684,"onversely , alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited together .",0
13685,"The average number of crossovers between two alleles — that is , their recombination frequency — correlated with their genetic distance from each other , relative to the locations of other genes on that chromosome .",1
13686,"Considering the example cross between AaBb and aabb above , the frequency of recombination could be calculated as 50/1000 = 0.05 .",0
13687," karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes , and includes their length , banding pattern , and centromere position .",1
13688,"To obtain a view of an individual ’s karyotype , cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart , or karyogram , also known as an ideogram ( [ link ] ) .",1
13689,"isorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes , as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes .",0
13690,"They are caused by nondisjunction , which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis .",1
13691,"Misaligned or incomplete synapsis , or a dysfunction of the spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration , can cause nondisjunction .",0
13692,n individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets ( two for diploid species ) is called polyploid .,1
13693,"For instance , fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote .",0
13694,"n inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere , or paracentric and occur outside of the centromere ( [ link ] ) .",0
13695,"A pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms , making these inversions easily identifiable .",0

13700,DNA polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction ( a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction ) .,0
13701,"ne strand , which is complementary to the 3 ' to 5 ' parental DNA strand , is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction .",1
13702,This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand .,0
13703,"The other strand , complementary to the 5 ' to 3 ' parental DNA , is extended away from the replication fork , in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments , each requiring a primer to start the synthesis .",0
13704,"he overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3 ' to 5 ' , and that of the leading strand 5 ' to 3 ' .",0
13705,A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides .,0
13706,The sliding clamp is a ring - shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place .,1
13707,ost of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added ( [ link ] ) .,0
13708,"In proofreading , the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one , so a correction can be made .",0
13709,The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand .,0
13710,rrors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA .,0
13711,"Mutations , variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome , can also occur because of damage to DNA .",1
13712,Such mutations may be of two types : induced or spontaneous .,0
13713,utations may have a wide range of effects .,0
13714,Some mutations are not expressed ; these are known as silent mutations .,1
13715,Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair .,1
13716,"ransition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind ; for example , a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine .",1
13717,"Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine , or vice versa ; for example , cytosine , a pyrimidine , is replaced by adenine , a purine .",1
13718,"Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base , known as an insertion , or the removal of a base , also known as deletion .",1
13719,"he flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the Central Dogma ( [ link ] ) , which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs , which in turn specify the sequence of proteins .",1
13720,The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs .,0
13721,his demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid .,1
13722,These nucleotide triplets are called codons .,0
13723,"The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame , thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid ( [ link ] ) .",0
13724,he central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid .,1
13725,"In addition , prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids , which are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes .",1
13726,Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance . Transcription in prokaryotes ( and in eukaryotes ) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis .,0
13727,"he nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5 ' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the + 1 site , or the initiation site .",1
13728,Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream .,0
13729,"oli , the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits , two of which are identical .",0
13730,"Four of these subunits , denoted α , α , β , and β ' comprise the polymerase core enzyme .",0
13731,"These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed , and they disassemble once transcription is complete .",0
13732,"lthough promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes , a few elements are conserved .",0
13733,"At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site , there are two promoter consensus sequences , or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species ( [ link ] ) .",1
13734,"The -10 consensus sequence , called the -10 region , is TATAAT .",1
13735,"he mRNA folds back on itself , and the complementary C – G nucleotides bind together .",0
13736,The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in A – T nucleotides .,0
13737,The complementary U – A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA .,0
13738,his sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors .,0
13739,"Further upstream of the TATA box , eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC - rich boxes ( GGCG ) or octamer boxes ( ATTTGCAT ) .",0

13743,"hen an in - frame AUG is encountered during translation elongation , a non - formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met - tRNAMet . In E. coli mRNA , a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon , called the Shine - Dalgarno sequence ( AGGAGG ) , interacts with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome .",1
13744,This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template .,0
13745,"uring and after translation , individual amino acids may be chemically modified , signal sequences may be appended , and the new protein “ folds ” into a distinct three - dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions .",0
13746,A signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment .,1
13747,These sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein ’s “ train ticket ” to its ultimate destination .,0
13748,"nce elongation is complete , the pre - mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU - rich sequence , leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre - mRNA .",0
13749,"An enzyme called poly - A polymerase then adds a string of approximately 200 A residues , called the poly - A tail .",1
13750,This modification further protects the pre - mRNA from degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm .,0
13751,"ome of a ribosome ’s RNA molecules are purely structural , whereas others have catalytic or binding activities .",0
13752,Mature tRNAs take on a three - dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end ( [ link ] ) .,0

13759,"If tryptophan is present in the environment , then E .",0
13760,"hen tryptophan is not present in the cell , the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator ; therefore , the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized .",0
13761,"Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off , the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators .",0
13762,"he lac Operon : An Inducer OperonThe third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons , which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell .",1

13778,TP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) .,0
13779,The eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit .,0
13780,"When bound , the methionine initiator tRNA associates with the eIF-2/40S ribosome complex , bringing along with it the mRNA to be translated .",0
13781,"hile these changes do n’t occur simultaneously in one cancer , changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals .",0
13782,"Therefore , changes in histone acetylation ( epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing ) , activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation , increased RNA stability , increased translational control , and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells .",1
13783,Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell .,0
13784,ost nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired ( such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample ) .,0
13785,Cells are broken using a lysis buffer ( a solution which is mostly a detergent ) ; lysis means “ to split . ” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes .,1
13786,"Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins , and ribonucleases ( RNAses ) that break down RNA .",0
13787,NA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR ( RT - PCR ) .,1
13788,The first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand ( called cDNA ) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA .,0
13789,he nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences .,0
13790,"When DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane , the technique is called Southern blotting , and when RNA is transferred to a nylon membrane , it is called northern blotting .",1
13791,"Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome , and northern blots are used to detect gene expression .",0
13792,"lasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large - scale production of important reagents , such as insulin and human growth hormone .",1
13793,An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning site ( MCS ) .,0
13794,The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases .,1
13795,hey are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis .,0
13796,Proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins .,1
13797,Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes .,0
13798,enetic engineering is the alteration of an organism ’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism ’s DNA to achieve desirable traits .,1
13799,The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering .,0
13800,he methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting .,0
13801,"Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene , either by introducing mutations in a gene , or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism .",1
13802,"n nature , the disease - causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids , called the Ti plasmids ( tumor - inducing plasmids ) , that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants .",1
13803,DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell ’s genome .,0
13804,he maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets .,0
13805,A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome .,1
13806,Genetic maps provide the big picture ( similar to a map of interstate highways ) and use genetic markers ( similar to landmarks ) .,0
13807,"he study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis , a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment .",1
13808,The term linkage was used before the discovery of DNA .,0
13809,"here are three methods used to create a physical map : cytogenetic mapping , radiation hybrid mapping , and sequence mapping .",0
13810,Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome ( [ link ] ) .,1
13811,"It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping , but not the exact distance ( number of base pairs ) .",0
13812,equence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs .,0
13813,The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA ( cDNA ) libraries ( collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome ) has sped up the process of physical mapping .,1
13814,"In March 2014 , a group of musicians got together in a fish market in Odessa for a spontaneous performance of Beethoven 's “ Ode to Joy ” from his Ninth Symphony .",0
13815,"While tensions were building over Ukraine 's efforts to join the European Union , and even as Russian troops had taken control of the Ukrainian airbase in Belbek , the Odessa Philharmonic Orchestra and Opera Chorus tried to lighten the troubled times for shoppers with music and song . Spontaneous gatherings like this are called flash mobs .",0
13816,They often are captured on video and shared on the Internet ; frequently they go viral .,0
13817,Turner and Killian ( 1993 ) identified four types of crowds .,0
13818,"Casual crowds consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are n’t really interacting , such as people standing in line at the post office .",1
13819,"Conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly , like a religious service .",1
13820,"They emphasize the importance of these norms in shaping crowd behavior , especially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors .",0
13821,"Emergent norm theory asserts that , in this circumstance , people perceive and respond to the crowd situation with their particular ( individual ) set of norms , which may change as the crowd experience evolves .",1
13822,"This focus on the individual component of interaction reflects a symbolic interactionist perspective . For Turner and Killian , the process begins when individuals suddenly find themselves in a new situation , or when an existing situation suddenly becomes strange or unfamiliar .",0
13823,"Social movements are purposeful , organized groups that strive to work toward a common social goal .",1
13824,"While most of us learned about social movements in history classes , we tend to take for granted the fundamental changes they caused —and we may be completely unfamiliar with the trend toward global social movements .",0
13825,"Examples include antinuclear groups , Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) , the Dreamers movement for immigration reform , and the Human Rights Campaign ’s advocacy for Marriage Equality .",0
13826,Revolutionary movements seek to completely change every aspect of society .,1
13827,"These include the 1960s counterculture movement , including the revolutionary group The Weather Underground , as well as anarchist collectives .",0
13828,"Churches and their ministers joined the struggle , and the protest organization In Friendship was formed as well as The Friendly Club and the Club From Nowhere .",0
13829,"A social movement industry , which is the collection of the social movement organizations that are striving toward similar goals , was growing . Martin Luther King Jr. emerged during these events to become the charismatic leader of the movement , gained respect from elites in the federal government , and aided by even more emerging SMOs such as the Student Non - Violent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , among others .",1
13830,Several still exist today .,0
13831,"As you can see , there may be many competing prognostic frames even within social movements adhering to similar diagnostic frames .",0
13832,"Finally , motivational framing is the call to action : what should you do once you agree with the diagnostic frame and believe in the prognostic frame ?",1
13833,These frames are action - oriented .,0
13834,"Collective behavior and social movements are just two of the forces driving social change , which is the change in society created through social movements as well as external factors like environmental shifts or technological innovations .",0
13835,"Essentially , any disruptive shift in the status quo , be it intentional or random , human - caused or natural , can lead to social change .",0
13836,"Sociology is the study of groups and group interactions , societies and social interactions , from small and personal groups to very large groups .",1
13837,"A group of people who live in a defined geographic area , who interact with one another , and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society .",1
13838,"The term culture refers to the group ’s shared practices , values , and beliefs .",1
13839,"Culture encompasses a group ’s way of life , from routine , everyday interactions to the most important parts of group members ' lives .",0
13840,"Some sociologists study social facts , which are the laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashions , rituals , and all of the cultural rules that govern social life , that may contribute to these changes in the family .",1
13841,Do people in the United States view marriage and family differently than before ?,0
13842,He argued that how an individual comes to view himself or herself is based to a very large extent on interactions with others .,0
13843,"Mead called specific individuals that impacted a person ’s life significant others , and he also conceptualized “ generalized others ” as the organized and generalized attitude of a social group .",1
13844,Mead ’s work is closely associated with the symbolic interactionist approach and emphasizes the micro - level of analysis .,0
13845,The different approaches to research based on positivism or antipositivism are often considered the foundation for the differences found today between quantitative sociology and qualitative sociology .,0
13846,Quantitative sociology uses statistical methods such as surveys with large numbers of participants .,1
13847,Researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior .,0
13848,"For example , although suicide is generally considered an individual phenomenon , Émile Durkheim was interested in studying the social factors that affect it .",0
13849,"His studied social ties within a group , or social solidarity , and hypothesized that differences in suicide rates might be explained by religion - based differences .",1
13850,"Durkheim gathered a large amount of data about Europeans who had ended their lives , and he did indeed find differences based on religion .",0
13851,"Functionalism , also called structural - functional theory , sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society .",1
13852,"Functionalism grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist , Hebert Spencer ( 1820–1903 ) , who saw similarities between society and the human body ; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning , the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning ( Spencer 1898 ) .",0
13853,"Alfred Radcliffe - Brown ( 1881–1955 ) defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole , and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity ( Radcliffe - Brown 1952 ) .",0
13854,"In a healthy society , all parts work together to maintain stability , a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as Parsons ( 1961 ) .",1
13855,"Latent functions can be beneficial , neutral , or harmful .",0
13856,Social processes that have undesirable consequences for the operation of society are called dysfunctions .,1
13857,"In education , examples of dysfunction include getting bad grades , truancy , dropping out , not graduating , and not finding suitable employment .",0
13858,"For example , while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference , a symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact , as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message .",0
13859,The focus on the importance of symbols in building a society led sociologists like Erving Goffman ( 1922–1982 ) to develop a technique called dramaturgical analysis .,0
13860,"Goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people ’s interactions showed patterns of cultural “ scripts . ” Because it can be unclear what part a person may play in a given situation , he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds ( Goffman 1958).Studies that use the symbolic interactionist perspective are more likely to use qualitative research methods , such as in - depth interviews or participant observation , because they seek to understand the symbolic worlds in which research subjects live .",1
13861,"Many people believe , for example , that crime rates go up when there ’s a full moon , but research does n’t support this opinion .",0
13862,Researchers Rotton and Kelly ( 1985 ) conducted a meta - analysis of research on the full moon ’s effects on behavior .,0
13863,Meta - analysis is a technique in which the results of virtually all previous studies on a specific subject are evaluated together .,1
13864,"In this field , results of studies tend to provide people with access to knowledge they did not have before — knowledge of other cultures , knowledge of rituals and beliefs , or knowledge of trends and attitudes .",0
13865,"No matter what research approach they use , researchers want to maximize the study ’s reliability , which refers to how likely research results are to be replicated if the study is reproduced .",1
13866,Reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group .,0
13867,"The next step researchers undertake is to conduct background research through a literature review , which is a review of any existing similar or related studies .",0
13868,A visit to the library and a thorough online search will uncover existing research about the topic of study .,0
13869,"In research , independent variables are the cause of the change .",1
13870,"The dependent variable is the effect , or thing that is changed .",1
13871,Researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics and that fit with their overall approaches to research .,0
13872,"In planning studies ' designs , sociologists generally choose from four widely used methods of social investigation : survey , field research , experiment , and secondary data analysis , or use of existing sources .",0
13873,"Every research method comes with plusses and minuses , and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use . Surveys",0
13874,"A survey targets a specific population , people who are the focus of a study , such as college athletes , international students , or teenagers living with type 1 ( juvenile - onset ) diabetes .",0
13875,"Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population , or a sample : that is , a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population .",1
13876,The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample .,0
13877,People are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously .,0
13878,This type of information is qualitative data — results that are subjective and often based on what is seen in a natural setting .,1
13879,Qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate .,0
13880,Much of the data gathered in field research are based not on cause and effect but on correlation .,0
13881,"And while field research looks for correlation , its small sample size does not allow for establishing a causal relationship between two variables .",0
13882,Sometimes a researcher wants to study one specific person or event .,0
13883,"A case study is an in - depth analysis of a single event , situation , or individual .",1
13884,"To conduct a case study , a researcher examines existing sources like documents and archival records , conducts interviews , engages in direct observation and even participant observation , if possible . Researchers might use this method to study a single case of , for example , a foster child , drug lord , cancer patient , criminal , or rape victim .",0
13885,"One of the advantages of secondary data is that it is nonreactive research ( or unobtrusive research ) , meaning that it does not include direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people ’s behaviors .",1
13886,"Unlike studies requiring direct contact with people , using previously published data does n’t require entering a population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process .",0
13887,"While he accepted that some aspects of research design might be influenced by personal values , he declared it was entirely inappropriate to allow personal values to shape the interpretation of the responses .",0
13888,"Sociologists , he stated , must establish value neutrality , a practice of remaining impartial , without bias or judgment , during the course of a study and in publishing results ( 1949 ) .",1
13889,Sociologists are obligated to disclose research findings without omitting or distorting significant data .,0
13890,"Nonmaterial culture , in contrast , consists of the ideas , attitudes , and beliefs of a society .",1
13891,"Material and nonmaterial aspects of culture are linked , and physical objects often symbolize cultural ideas .",0
13892,"The first , and perhaps most crucial , elements of culture we will discuss are its values and beliefs .",0
13893,Values are a culture ’s standard for discerning what is good and just in society .,1
13894,Values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching a culture ’s beliefs .,0
13895,"Values portray an ideal culture , the standards society would like to embrace and live up to .",1
13896,"But ideal culture differs from real culture , the way society actually is , based on what occurs and exists .",1
13897,"In an ideal culture , there would be no traffic accidents , murders , poverty , or racial tension .",0
13898,"These examples describe the visible and invisible rules of conduct through which societies are structured , or what sociologists call norms .",1
13899,"Norms define how to behave in accordance with what a society has defined as good , right , and important , and most members of the society adhere to them .",0
13900,Breaching experiments uncover and explore the many unwritten social rules we live by . Norms may be further classified as either mores or folkways .,0
13901,Mores ( mor - ays ) are norms that embody the moral views and principles of a group .,1
13902,Violating them can have serious consequences .,0
13903,"While different cultures have varying systems of symbols , one symbol is common to all : language .",0
13904,Language is a symbolic system through which people communicate and through which culture is transmitted .,1
13905,"Some languages contain a system of symbols used for written communication , while others rely on only spoken communication and nonverbal actions .",0
13906,The term popular culture refers to the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in mainstream society .,1
13907,"Popular culture events might include a parade , a baseball game , or the season finale of a television show .",0
13908,An innovation refers to an object or concept ’s initial appearance in society — it ’s innovative because it is markedly new .,1
13909,There are two ways to come across an innovative object or idea : discover it or invent it .,0
13910,"Material culture tends to diffuse more quickly than nonmaterial culture ; technology can spread through society in a matter of months , but it can take generations for the ideas and beliefs of society to change .",0
13911,Sociologist William F. Ogburn coined the term culture lag to refer to this time that elapses between the introduction of a new item of material culture and its acceptance as part of nonmaterial culture ( Ogburn 1957 ) .,1
13912,Culture lag can also cause tangible problems .,0
13913,Exactly what is a society ?,0
13914,"In sociological terms , society refers to a group of people who live in a definable community and share the same culture .",1
13915,"On a broader scale , society consists of the people and institutions around us , our shared beliefs , and our cultural ideas .",0
13916,"Previously , the depletion of a region ’s crops or water supply forced pastoral societies to relocate in search of food sources for their livestock .",0
13917,Horticultural societies formed in areas where rainfall and other conditions allowed them to grow stable crops .,0
13918,"They were similar to hunter - gatherers in that they largely depended on the environment for survival , but since they did n’t have to abandon their location to follow resources , they were able to start permanent settlements .",0
13919,"Postindustrial SocietyInformation societies , sometimes known as postindustrial or digital societies , are a recent development .",0
13920,"Unlike industrial societies that are rooted in the production of material goods , information societies are based on the production of information and services .",1
13921,"In his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ If I do not submit to the conventions of society , if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class , the ridicule I provoke , the social isolation in which I am kept , produce , although in an attenuated form , the same effects as punishment ” ( Durkheim 1895 ) .",0
13922,"Durkheim also believed that social integration , or the strength of ties that people have to their social groups , was a key factor in social life . Following the ideas of Comte and Spencer , Durkheim likened society to a living organism , in which each organ plays a necessary role in keeping the being alive .",1
13923,"Even the socially deviant members of society are necessary , Durkheim argued , as punishments for deviance affirm established cultural values and norms .",0
13924,Laws exist as formalized morals and are based on restitution rather than revenge .,0
13925,"While the transition from mechanical to organic solidarity is , in the long run , advantageous for a society , Durkheim noted that it can be a time of chaos and “ normlessness . ” One of the outcomes of the transition is something he called social anomie .",0
13926,"Anomie — literally , “ without law ” — is a situation in which society no longer has the support of a firm collective consciousness .",1
13927,Marx described modern society in terms of alienation .,0
13928,"Alienation refers to the condition in which the individual is isolated and divorced from his or her society , work , or the sense of self .",1
13929,Marx defined four specific types of alienation .,0
13930,Weber ’s analysis of modern society centered on the concept of rationalization .,0
13931,A rational society is one built around logic and efficiency rather than morality or tradition .,1
13932,"In a sense , it exists by consensus , both prior and current .",0
13933,"This is an example of the process of institutionalization , the act of implanting a convention or norm into society .",1
13934,"Bear in mind that the institution , while socially constructed , is still quite real .",0
13935,"Roles and StatusAs you can imagine , people employ many types of behaviors in day - to - day life .",0
13936,Roles are patterns of behavior that we recognize in each other that are representative of a person ’s social status .,1
13937,"Currently , while reading this text , you are playing the role of a student .",0
13938,"Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .",1
13939,"Others , called achieved statuses , are obtained by choice , such as a high school dropout , self - made millionaire , or nurse .",1
13940,"As a daughter or son , you occupy a different status than as a neighbor or employee .",0
13941,"Consider the duties of a parent : cooking , cleaning , driving , problem - solving , acting as a source of moral guidance — the list goes on .",0
13942,"Similarly , a person can experience role conflict when one or more roles are contradictory .",0
13943,A parent who also has a full - time career can experience role conflict on a daily basis .,0
13944,"In the 1850s , as the urban population greatly expanded and transportation options improved , suburbs developed .",0
13945,"Suburbs are the communities surrounding cities , typically close enough for a daily commute in , but far enough away to allow for more space than city living affords .",1
13946,The bucolic suburban landscape of the early twentieth century has largely disappeared due to sprawl .,0
13947,"Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .",0
13948,"New York was the first U.S. megalopolis , a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs .",1
13949,These metropolises use vast quantities of natural resources and are a growing part of the U.S. landscape . The suburban sprawl in Toronto means long commutes and traffic congestion .,0
13950,"The world ’s most densely populated cities are now largely concentrated in the global south , a marked change from several decades ago when the biggest cities were found in the global north .",0
13951,"In the next forty years , the biggest global challenge for urbanized populations , particularly in less developed countries , will be to achieve development that occurs without depleting or damaging the natural environment , also called sustainable development ( United Nations , Department of Economic and Social Affairs , Population Division 2014 ) .",1
13952,The subfield of environmental sociology studies the way humans interact with their environments .,1
13953,"This field is closely related to human ecology , which focuses on the relationship between people and their built and natural environment .",1
13954,And it is far more problematic than even the mountains of broken plastic and rusty metal that plague the environment .,0
13955,"E - waste is the name for obsolete , broken , and worn - out electronics — from computers to mobile phones to televisions .",1
13956,"The challenge is that these products , which are multiplying at alarming rates thanks in part to planned obsolescence ( the designing of products to quickly become outdated and then be replaced by the constant emergence of newer and cheaper electronics ) , have toxic chemicals and precious metals in them , which makes for a dangerous combination .",1
13957,"Without regular interaction — the holding , hugging , talking , the explanations and demonstrations given to most young children — she had not learned to walk or to speak , to eat or to interact , to play or even to understand the world around her .",0
13958,"From a sociological point of view , Danielle had not been socialized . Socialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of a society .",1
13959,"It describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations , to accept society ’s beliefs , and to be aware of societal values .",0
13960,"Sociologists measure fertility using the crude birthrate ( the number of live births per 1,000 people per year ) .",1
13961,"Just as fertility measures childbearing , the mortality rate is a measure of the number of people who die .",1
13962,"The crude death rate is a number derived from the number of deaths per 1,000 people per year .",1
13963,Moral development is an important part of the socialization process .,0
13964,"The term refers to the way people learn what society considered to be “ good ” and “ bad , ” which is important for a smoothly functioning society .",1
13965,"Fracking , another word for hydraulic fracturing , is a method used to recover gas and oil from shale by drilling down into the earth and directing a high - pressure mixture of water , sand , and proprietary chemicals into the rock .",1
13966,"Commonly , this process also includes drilling horizontally into the rock to create new pathways for gas to travel .",0
13967,"First , members entering an institution must leave behind their old identity through what is known as a degradation ceremony .",0
13968,"In a degradation ceremony , new members lose the aspects of their old identity and are given new identities .",1
13969,The process is sometimes gentle .,0
13970,Another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way .,1
13971,"These people are considered a category , and as an example all children born from approximately 1980–2000 are referred to as “ Millennials . ” Why are Millennials a category and not a group ?",1
13972,"Because while some of them may share a sense of identity , they do not , as a whole , interact frequently with each other . Interestingly , people within an aggregate or category can become a group .",0
13973,They may also be task - focused and time - limited .,0
13974,"These groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one , meaning that their role is more goal- or task - oriented than emotional .",0
13975,A classroom or office can be an example of a secondary group .,0
13976,"A small group is typically one where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the group know each other and share simultaneous interaction , such as a nuclear family , a dyad , or a triad .",1
13977,"Georg Simmel ( 1858–1915 ) wrote extensively about the difference between a dyad , or two - member group , and a triad , which is a three - member group ( Simmel 1902 ) .",1
13978,"In the former , if one person withdraws , the group can no longer exist .",0
13979,A further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution .,0
13980,"In contrast , a laissez - faire leader ( French for “ leave it alone ” ) is hands - off , allowing group members to self - manage and make their own decisions .",1
13981,"An example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard , leaves materials on the shelves , and tells students to help themselves and make some art .",0
13982,The Audubon Society and a ski club are examples of normative organizations .,0
13983,"Coercive organizations are groups that we must be coerced , or pushed , to join .",1
13984,These may include prison or a rehabilitation center .,0
13985,"People often complain about bureaucracies––declaring them slow , rule - bound , difficult to navigate , and unfriendly .",0
13986,"Let ’s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to understand what they mean . Hierarchy of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places one individual or office in charge of another , who in turn must answer to her own superiors .",1
13987,"For example , as an employee at Walmart , your shift manager assigns you tasks .",0
13988,"Finally , bureaucracies are also characterized by impersonality , which takes personal feelings out of professional situations .",1

14002,"Those who do , however , have often been labeled “ deviant ” by society and have gradually come to believe it themselves .",0
14003,Labeling theory examines the ascribing of a deviant behavior to another person by members of society .,1
14004,"Thus , what is considered deviant is determined not so much by the behaviors themselves or the people who commit them , but by the reactions of others to these behaviors .",0
14005,"If you use a crowbar to break into a car , you are committing a nonviolent crime ; if you mug someone with the crowbar , you are committing a violent crime .",0

14047,"In this section , we will look more closely at how media globalization and technological globalization play out in a sociological perspective .",0
14048,"As the names suggest , media globalization is the worldwide integration of media through the cross - cultural exchange of ideas , while technological globalization refers to the cross - cultural development and exchange of technology .",1
14049,"Technological globalization is speeded in large part by technological diffusion , the spread of technology across borders .",1

14053,This surveillance was imagined as a form of constant monitoring in which the observation posts are decentralized and the observed is never communicated with directly .,0
14054,Neo - Luddites are people who see technology as symbolizing the coldness and alienation of modern life .,1
14055,"But for technophiles , technology symbolizes the potential for a brighter future .",1
14056,"Another key exception to the right to freedom of expression is obscenity , acts or statements that are extremely offensive under current societal standards .",0
14057,"Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity , having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building , “ I know it when I see it . ” Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone .",0
14058,"In 1973 , the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene : “ ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value.”Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15 ( 1973 ) .",0
14059,"However , the application of this standard has at times been problematic .",0
14060,"Furthermore , the courts have ruled that , although public school officials are government actors , the First Amendment freedom of expression rights of children attending public schools are somewhat limited .",0
14061,"In particular , in Tinker v. Des Moines ( 1969 ) and Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier ( 1988 ) , the Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on speech that creates “ substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others”Tinker v.

14065,"Before the Civil War , this would have been a nearly meaningless distinction .",0
14066,"In most states at that time , white males of military age were considered part of the militia , liable to be called for service to put down rebellions or invasions , and the right “ to keep and bear Arms ” was considered a common - law right inherited from English law that predated the federal and state constitutions .",0
14067,"The Constitution was not seen as a limitation on state power , and since the states expected all able - bodied free men to keep arms as a matter of course , what gun control there was mostly revolved around ensuring slaves ( and their abolitionist allies ) did n’t have guns .",0
14068,"However , in 2008 , in a narrow 5–4 decision on District of Columbia v. Heller , the Supreme Court found that at least some gun control laws did violate the Second Amendment and that this amendment does protect an individual ’s right to keep and bear arms , at least in some circumstances — in particular , “ for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self - defense within the home.”District of Columbia et al .",0
14069,"v. Heller , 554 US 570 ( 2008 ) , p. 3 .",0

14071,The Fourth Amendment sits at the boundary between general individual freedoms and the rights of those suspected of crimes .,0
14072,We saw earlier that perhaps it reflects James Madison ’s broader concern about establishing an expectation of privacy from government intrusion at home .,0
14073,What happens if the police conduct an illegal search or seizure without a warrant and find evidence of a crime ?,0
14074,"In the 1961 Supreme Court case Mapp v. Ohio , the court decided that evidence obtained without a warrant that did n’t fall under one of the exceptions mentioned above could not be used as evidence in a state criminal trial , giving rise to the broad application of what is known as the exclusionary rule , which was first established in 1914 on a federal level in Weeks v. United States . Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 ( 1961 ) ; Weeks v. United States , 232 U.S. 383 ( 1914 ) .",0
14075,The exclusionary rule does n’t just apply to evidence found or to items or people seized without a warrant ( or falling under an exception noted above ) ; it also applies to any evidence developed or discovered as a result of the illegal search or seizure .,0
14076,"The Fifth Amendment also protects individuals against double jeopardy , a process that subjects a suspect to prosecution twice for the same criminal act .",0
14077,No one who has been acquitted ( found not guilty ) of a crime can be prosecuted again for that crime .,0
14078,"Moreover , in a criminal trial , if someone does not testify in his or her own defense , the prosecution can not use that failure to testify as evidence of guilt or imply that an innocent person would testify .",0
14079,"This provision became embedded in the public consciousness following the Supreme Court ’s 1966 ruling in Miranda v. Arizona , whereby suspects were required to be informed of their most important rights , including the right against self - incrimination , before being interrogated in police custody . Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 ( 1966 ) .",1
14080,"However , contrary to some media depictions of the Miranda warning , law enforcement officials do not necessarily have to inform suspects of their rights before they are questioned in situations where they are free to leave .",0
14081,"And , while we traditionally think of property owners as relatively well - off people whose rights do n’t necessarily need protecting since they can fend for themselves in the political system , frequently these cases pit lower- and middle - class homeowners against multinational corporations or multimillionaires with the ear of city and state officials .",0
14082,"In a notorious 2005 case , Kelo v. City of New London , the Supreme Court sided with municipal officials taking homes in a middle - class neighborhood to obtain land for a large pharmaceutical company ’s corporate campus . Kelo et al .",1

14084,"The case led to a public backlash against the use of eminent domain and legal changes in many states , making it harder for cities to take property from one private party and give it to another for economic redevelopment purposes .",0
14085,"Bail is a payment of money that allows a person accused of a crime to be freed pending trial ; if you “ make bail ” in a case and do not show up for your trial , you will forfeit the money you paid .",1
14086,"Since many people can not afford to pay bail directly , they may instead get a bail bond , which allows them to pay a fraction of the money ( typically 10 percent ) to a person who sells bonds and who pays the full bail amount .",1
14087,"( In most states , the bond seller makes money because the defendant does not get back the money for the bond , and most people show up for their trials . )",0
14088,"As this chapter has suggested , the provisions of the Bill of Rights have been interpreted and reinterpreted repeatedly over the past two centuries .",0
14089,"However , the first eight amendments are largely silent on the status of traditional common law , which was the legal basis for many of the natural rights claimed by the framers in the Declaration of Independence .",0
14090,"Unlike the other provisions of the Bill of Rights , this amendment focuses on power rather than rights .",0
14091,"The courts have generally read the Tenth Amendment as merely stating , as Chief Justice Harlan Stone put it , a “ truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.”United States v. Darby Lumber , 312 U.S. 100 ( 1941 ) .",0
14092,"In other words , rather than limiting the power of the federal government in any meaningful way , it simply restates what is made obvious elsewhere in the Constitution : the federal government has both enumerated and implied powers , but where the federal government does not ( or chooses not to ) exercise power , the states may do so .",0
14093,"The legal landscape changed dramatically as a result of the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade , Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 ( 1973 ) .",0
14094,"in which the Supreme Court decided the right to privacy encompassed a right for women to terminate a pregnancy , at least under certain scenarios .",1
14095,"The justices ruled that while the government did have an interest in protecting the “ potentiality of human life , ” nonetheless this had to be balanced against the interests of both women ’s health and women ’s right to decide whether to have an abortion .",0
14096,"In the United States , many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act ( i.e. , Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ) , passed weeks after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 , have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or , in some cases , to bypass warrant requirements altogether .",0
14097,"Critics have argued that the Patriot Act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals , in particular drug dealers , rather than terrorists as intended .",0
14098,"We can contrast civil rights with civil liberties , which are limitations on government power designed to protect our fundamental freedoms .",1
14099,"For example , the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of “ cruel and unusual punishments ” to those convicted of crimes , a limitation on government power .",0
14100,Discrimination based on gender or sex is generally examined with intermediate scrutiny .,0
14101,"The standard of intermediate scrutiny was first applied by the Supreme Court in Craig v. Boren ( 1976 ) and again in Clark v. Jeter ( 1988).Craig v. Boren , 429 U.S. 190 ( 1976 ) ; Clark v. Jeter , 486 U.S. 456 ( 1988 ) .",0
14102,"It requires the government to demonstrate that treating men and women differently is “ substantially related to an important governmental objective . ” This puts the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate why the unequal treatment is justifiable , not on the individual who alleges unfair discrimination has taken place .",0
14103,"In practice , this means laws that treat men and women differently are sometimes upheld , although usually they are not .",0
14104,The Republican majority in Congress was enraged by the actions of the reconstituted governments of the southern states .,0
14105,"In these states , many former Confederate politicians and their sympathizers returned to power and attempted to circumvent the Thirteenth Amendment ’s freeing of slaves by passing laws known as the black codes .",0
14106,These laws were designed to reduce former slaves to the status of serfs or indentured servants ; blacks were not just denied the right to vote but also could be arrested and jailed for vagrancy or idleness if they lacked jobs .,1
14107,One way to get involved in the fight for civil rights is to stay informed .,0
14108,"The Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) is a not - for - profit advocacy group based in Montgomery , Alabama .",1
14109,"Lawyers for the SPLC specialize in civil rights litigation and represent many people whose rights have been violated , from victims of hate crimes to undocumented immigrants .",0
14110,"At the end of the Civil War , the South entered a period called Reconstruction ( 1865–1877 ) during which state governments were reorganized before the rebellious states were allowed to be readmitted to the Union .",1
14111,"As part of this process , the Republican Party pushed for a permanent end to slavery .",0
14112,"The Fifteenth Amendment stated that people could not be denied the right to vote based on “ race , color , or previous condition of servitude . ” This construction allowed states to continue to decide the qualifications of voters as long as those qualifications were ostensibly race - neutral .",1
14113,"Thus , while states could not deny African American men the right to vote on the basis of race , they could deny it to women on the basis of sex or to people who could not prove they were literate .",0
14114,"Similarly , state and local governments passed laws limiting what neighborhoods blacks and whites could live in .",0
14115,"Collectively , these discriminatory laws came to be known as Jim Crow laws .",0
14116,"The Supreme Court upheld the separate but equal doctrine in 1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson , consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment ’s equal protection clause , and allowed segregation to continue . Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U.S. 537 ( 1896 ) .",0

14125,"These newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches , including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations .",0
14126,Civil rights pioneers adopted these measures in the 1955–1956 Montgomery bus boycott .,0
14127,"After Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white person and was arrested , a group of black women carried out a day - long boycott of Montgomery ’s public transit system .",0
14128,This boycott was then extended for over a year and overseen by union organizer E. D. Nixon .,0

14132,"Progress in registering African American voters remained slow in many states despite increased federal activity supporting it , so civil rights leaders including Martin Luther King , Jr. decided to draw the public eye to the area where the greatest resistance to voter registration drives were taking place .",0

14136,"Today , a lack of high - paying jobs in many urban areas , combined with persistent racism , has trapped many African Americans in poor neighborhoods .",0
14137,"While the Civil Rights Act of 1964 created opportunities for members of the black middle class to advance economically and socially , and to live in the same neighborhoods as the white middle class did , their departure left many black neighborhoods mired in poverty and without the strong community ties that existed during the era of legal segregation .",0

14315,"Cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and creativity .",1
14316,"Psychosocial development involves emotions , personality , and social relationships .",1
14317,"This approach asks , “ What is normal development ? ” In the early decades of the 20th century , normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms ( i.e. , average ages ) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains ( Gesell , 1933 , 1939 , 1940 ; Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ; Hall , 1904 ) .",0
14318,"Although children develop at slightly different rates , we can use these age - related averages as general guidelines to compare children with same - age peers to determine the approximate ages they should reach specific normative events called developmental milestones ( e.g. , crawling , walking , writing , dressing , naming colors , speaking in sentences , and starting puberty ) .",0
14319,These findings suggest the heritability of some personality traits .,0
14320,Heritability refers to the proportion of difference among people that is attributed to genetics .,1
14321,"Some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a 0.50 heritability ratio include leadership , obedience to authority , a sense of well - being , alienation , resistance to stress , and fearfulness .",0
14322,"Freud viewed development as discontinuous ; he believed that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood , and that if we lack proper nurturance and parenting during a stage , we may become stuck , or fixated , in that stage .",0
14323,Freud ’s stages are called the stages of psychosexual development .,0
14324,"According to Freud , children ’s pleasure - seeking urges are focused on a different area of the body , called an erogenous zone , at each of the five stages of development : oral , anal , phallic , latency , and genital . While most of Freud ’s ideas have not found support in modern research , we can not discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of psychology .",1
14325,"First , they assimilate new information or experiences in terms of their current schemata : assimilation is when they take in information that is comparable to what they already know .",1
14326,Accommodation describes when they change their schemata based on new information .,1
14327,This process continues as children interact with their environment .,0
14328,"Piaget ’s second stage is the preoperational stage , which is from approximately 2 to 7 years old .",1
14329,"In this stage , children can use symbols to represent words , images , and ideas , which is why children in this stage engage in pretend play .",0
14330,"Piaget ’s third stage is the concrete operational stage , which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old .",1
14331,"In this stage , children can think logically about real ( concrete ) events ; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and start to employ memory strategies .",0
14332,A major task beginning in childhood and continuing into adolescence is discerning right from wrong .,0
14333,Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg ( 1927–1987 ) extended upon the foundation that Piaget built regarding cognitive development .,0
14334,"Kohlberg believed that moral development , like cognitive development , follows a series of stages .",0
14335,The field of social psychology studies topics at both the intra- and interpersonal levels .,0
14336,"Intrapersonal topics ( those that pertain to the individual ) include emotions and attitudes , the self , and social cognition ( the ways in which we think about ourselves and others ) .",1
14337,"Interpersonal topics ( those that pertain to dyads and groups ) include helping behavior ( [ link ] ) , aggression , prejudice and discrimination , attraction and close relationships , and group processes and intergroup relationships .",1
14338,Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and surroundings .,1
14339,"In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .",1
14340,An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament .,1
14341,"When you do well at a task , for example acing an exam , it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your behavior ( “ I ’m smart , ” ) instead of a situational one ( “ The exam was easy , ” ) .",0
14342,"The tendency of an individual to take credit by making dispositional or internal attributions for positive outcomes but situational or external attributions for negative outcomes is known as the self - serving bias ( Miller & Ross , 1975 ) .",1
14343,This bias serves to protect self - esteem .,0
14344,"During the first week after conception , the zygote divides and multiplies , going from a one - cell structure to two cells , then four cells , then eight cells , and so on .",1
14345,This process of cell division is called mitosis .,0
14346,"Mitosis is a fragile process , and fewer than one - half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two weeks ( Hall , 2004 ) .",0
14347,The developing fetus is completely dependent on the mother for life .,0
14348,"It is important that the mother takes good care of herself and receives prenatal care , which is medical care during pregnancy that monitors the health of both the mother and the fetus ( [ link ] ) .",1
14349,"According to the National Institutes of Health ( [ NIH ] , 2013 ) , routine prenatal care is important because it can reduce the risk of complications to the mother and fetus during pregnancy .",0
14350,"Although small , a newborn is not completely helpless because his reflexes and sensory capacities help him interact with the environment from the moment of birth .",0
14351,All healthy babies are born with newborn reflexes : inborn automatic responses to particular forms of stimulation .,1
14352,Reflexes help the newborn survive until it is capable of more complex behaviors — these reflexes are crucial to survival .,0

14354,"Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements ( e.g. , balancing , running , and jumping ) .",1
14355,"A fourth style , known as disorganized attachment , was later described ( Main & Solomon , 1990 ) .",0
14356,The most common type of attachment — also considered the healthiest — is called secure attachment ( [ link ] ) .,0
14357,"In this type of attachment , the toddler prefers his parent over a stranger .",0
14358,"For parents who employ the permissive style of parenting , the kids run the show and anything goes .",0
14359,Permissive parents make few demands and rarely use punishment .,0
14360,"In pre - industrial society , children were considered adults when they reached physical maturity , but today we have an extended time between childhood and adulthood called adolescence .",0
14361,"Adolescence is the period of development that begins at puberty and ends at emerging adulthood , which is discussed later .",1
14362,"In the United States , adolescence is seen as a time to develop independence from parents while remaining connected to them ( [ link ] ) .",0
14363,"Primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction , like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males .",1
14364,"Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .",1
14365,"Girls experience menarche , the beginning of menstrual periods , usually around 12–13 years old , and boys experience spermarche , the first ejaculation , around 13–14 years old .",1
14366,One major social determinant of human behavior is our social roles .,0
14367,"A social role is a pattern of behavior that is expected of a person in a given setting or group ( Hare , 2003 ) .",1
14368,Each one of us has several social roles .,0
14369,"Because of social roles , people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific , familiar settings .",0
14370,"A script is a person ’s knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting ( Schank & Abelson , 1977 ) .",1
14371,"How do you act on the first day of school , when you walk into an elevator , or are at a restaurant ?",0
14372,Visit this website to hear an NPR interview with Philip Zimbardo where he discusses the parallels between the Stanford prison experiment and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .,0
14373,"When we experience cognitive dissonance , we are motivated to decrease it because it is psychologically , physically , and mentally uncomfortable .",0
14374,"We can reduce cognitive dissonance by bringing our cognitions , attitudes , and behaviors in line — that is , making them harmonious .",0
14375,"This can be done in different ways , such as :",0
14376,"In the previous section we discussed that the motivation to reduce cognitive dissonance leads us to change our attitudes , behaviors , and/or cognitions to make them consonant .",0
14377,Persuasion is the process of changing our attitude toward something based on some kind of communication .,1
14378,Much of the persuasion we experience comes from outside forces .,0
14379,"One effective strategy is the foot - in - the - door technique ( Cialdini , 2001 ; Pliner , Hart , Kohl , & Saari , 1974 ) .",0
14380,"Using the foot - in - the - door technique , the persuader gets a person to agree to bestow a small favor or to buy a small item , only to later request a larger favor or purchase of a bigger item .",1
14381,The foot - in - the - door technique was demonstrated in a study by Freedman and Fraser ( 1966 ) in which participants who agreed to post small sign in their yard or sign a petition were more likely to agree to put a large sign in their yard than people who declined the first request ( [ link ] ) .,0
14382,Asch ( 1955 ) found that 76 % of participants conformed to group pressure at least once by indicating the incorrect line .,0
14383,"Conformity is the change in a person ’s behavior to go along with the group , even if he does not agree with the group .",1
14384,Why would people give the wrong answer ?,0
14385,"Stanley Milgram was a social psychology professor at Yale who was influenced by the trial of Adolf Eichmann , a Nazi war criminal .",1
14386,"Eichmann ’s defense for the atrocities he committed was that he was “ just following orders . ” Milgram ( 1963 ) wanted to test the validity of this defense , so he designed an experiment and initially recruited 40 men for his experiment .",0
14387,Another phenomenon that occurs within group settings is group polarization .,0
14388,"Group polarization ( Teger & Pruitt , 1967 ) is the strengthening of an original group attitude after the discussion of views within a group .",1
14389,"That is , if a group initially favors a viewpoint , after discussion the group consensus is likely a stronger endorsement of the viewpoint .",0
14390,It impacts their lives and their family ’s lives in positive and negative physical and psychological ways .,0
14391,Industrial and organizational ( I - O ) psychology is a branch of psychology that studies how human behavior and psychology affect work and how they are affected by work .,1
14392,"As a result of its interest in worker wellbeing and relationships , organizational psychology also considers the subjects of harassment , including sexual harassment , and workplace violence .",0
14393,"Human factors psychology is the study of how workers interact with the tools of work and how to design those tools to optimize workers’ productivity , safety , and health .",1
14394,"These studies can involve interactions as straightforward as the fit of a desk , chair , and computer to a human having to sit on the chair at the desk using the computer for several hours each day .",0
14395,"Analysis of the findings by later researchers led to the term the Hawthorne effect , which describes the increase in performance of individuals who are noticed , watched , and paid attention to by researchers or supervisors [ link ] ) .",1
14396,"What the original researchers found was that any change in a variable , such as lighting levels , led to an improvement in productivity ; this was true even when the change was negative , such as a return to poor lighting .",0
14397,"Today , I - O psychology is a diverse and deep field of research and practice , as you will learn about in the rest of this chapter .",0
14398,"The Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology ( SIOP ) , a division of the APA , lists 8,000 members ( SIOP , 2014 ) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics — U.S .",0
14399,Department of Labor ( 2013 ) has projected this profession will have the greatest growth of all job classifications in the 20 years following 2012 .,0
14400,"On average , a person with a master ’s degree in industrial - organizational psychology will earn over $ 80,000 a year , while someone with a doctorate will earn over $ 110,000 a year ( Khanna , Medsker , & Ginter , 2012 ) .",0
14401,"Sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people , and this behavior is known as discrimination .",0
14402,"Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one ’s membership in a particular group ( Allport , 1954 ; Dovidio & Gaertner , 2004 ) .",1
14403,"As a result of holding negative beliefs ( stereotypes ) and negative attitudes ( prejudice ) about a particular group , people often treat the target of prejudice poorly , such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends .",0
14404,Prejudice and discrimination persist in society due to social learning and conformity to social norms .,0
14405,"Children learn prejudiced attitudes and beliefs from society : their parents , teachers , friends , the media , and other sources of socialization , such as Facebook ( O’Keeffe & Clarke - Pearson , 2011 ) .",0
14406,"When interacting with the target of our prejudice , we tend to pay attention to information that is consistent with our stereotypic expectations and ignore information that is inconsistent with our expectations .",0
14407,"In this process , known as confirmation bias , we seek out information that supports our stereotypes and ignore information that is inconsistent with our stereotypes ( Wason & Johnson - Laird , 1972 ) .",1
14408,"In the job interview example , the employer may not have noticed that the job applicant was friendly and engaging , and that he provided competent responses to the interview questions in the beginning of the interview .",0
14409,"Because we often feel a strong sense of belonging and emotional connection to our in - groups , we develop in - group bias : a preference for our own group over other groups .",1
14410,This in - group bias can result in prejudice and discrimination because the out - group is perceived as different and is less preferred than our in - group .,0
14411,Aggression takes two forms depending on one ’s motives : hostile or instrumental .,0
14412,Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression .,1
14413,"In contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain ( Berkowitz , 1993 ) ; a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression .",1
14414,One form of negative social interactions among children that has become a national concern is bullying .,0
14415,"Bullying is repeated negative treatment of another person , often an adolescent , over time ( Olweus , 1993 ) .",1
14416,A one - time incident in which one child hits another child on the playground would not be considered bullying : Bullying is repeated behavior .,0
14417,"This is a common occurrence , as the following well - publicized event demonstrates .",0
14418,"In 1964 , in Queens , New York , a 19-year - old woman named Kitty Genovese was attacked by a person with a knife near the back entrance to her apartment building and again in the hallway inside her apartment building .",0
14419,"When the attack occurred , she screamed for help numerous times and eventually died from her stab wounds .",0
14420,"When you and another person share similar music taste , hobbies , food preferences , and so on , deciding what to do with your time together might be easy .",0
14421,"Homophily is the tendency for people to form social networks , including friendships , marriage , business relationships , and many other types of relationships , with others who are similar ( McPherson et al . , 2001 ) .",1
14422,"Robert Sternberg ( 1986 ) proposed that there are three components of love : intimacy , passion , and commitment .",0
14423,These three components form a triangle that defines multiple types of love : this is known as Sternberg ’s triangular theory of love ( [ link ] ) .,0
14424,Intimacy is the sharing of details and intimate thoughts and emotions .,1
14425,"Companionate love , which is characteristic of close friendships and family relationships , consists of intimacy and commitment but no passion .",1
14426,"Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy , but no commitment .",1
14427,"Finally , fatuous love is defined by having passion and commitment , but no intimacy , such as a long term sexual love affair .",1
14428,This allows the I - O psychologist to access previous analyses for nearly any type of occupation .,0
14429,This system is called O*Net ( accessible at www.online.onetcenter.org ) .,0
14430,The site is open and you can see the KSAs that are listed for your own position or one you might be curious about .,0
14431,"Unless membership in that group directly affects potential job performance , a decision based on group membership is discriminatory ( [ link ] ) .",0
14432,"To combat hiring discrimination , in the United States there are numerous city , state , and federal laws that prevent hiring based on various group - membership criteria .",0
14433,"For example , did you know it is illegal for a potential employer to ask your age in an interview ?",0
14434,"The Civil Rights Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act make provisions for bona fide occupational qualifications ( BFOQs ) , which are requirements of certain occupations for which denying an individual employment would otherwise violate the law .",1
14435,"For example , there may be cases in which religion , national origin , age , and sex are bona fide occupational qualifications .",0
14436,Job stress affects job satisfaction .,0
14437,"Job stress , or job strain , is caused by specific stressors in an occupation .",0
14438,Flextime usually involves a requirement of core hours spent in the workplace around which the employee may schedule his arrival and departure from work to meet family demands .,0
14439,"Telecommuting involves employees working at home and setting their own hours , which allows them to work during different parts of the day , and to spend part of the day with their family .",0
14440,Recall that Yahoo !,0
14441,"In the Theory Y approach , on the other hand , managers assume that most people seek inner satisfaction and fulfillment from their work .",1
14442,"Employees function better under leadership that allows them to participate in , and provide input about , setting their personal and work goals .",0
14443,Organizations need to respond quickly to changes in these factors .,0
14444,"Many companies are responding to these changes by structuring their organizations so that work can be delegated to work teams , which bring together diverse skills , experience , and expertise .",0
14445,"This is in contrast to organizational structures that have individuals at their base ( Naquin & Tynan , 2003 ) .",0
14446,"One well - recognized negative aspect of organizational culture is a culture of harassment , including sexual harassment .",0
14447,Most organizations of any size have developed sexual harassment policies that define sexual harassment ( or harassment in general ) and the procedures the organization has set in place to prevent and address it when it does occur .,0
14448,This is a demonstration of the importance of procedural justice in organizations .,0
14449,Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the processes by which outcomes are determined in conflicts with or among employees .,1
14450,"The term stress as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the 1930s , but it did not enter the popular vernacular until the 1970s ( Lyon , 2012 ) .",0
14451,"Today , we often use the term loosely in describing a variety of unpleasant feeling states ; for example , we often say we are stressed out when we feel frustrated , angry , conflicted , overwhelmed , or fatigued .",0
14452,"A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well - being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .",0
14453,"A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — demanding or threatening events ( often referred to as stressors ) ; these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events .",1
14454,Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals .,0
14455,"He argued that stress can sometimes be a positive , motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives .",0
14456,"This kind of stress , which Selye called eustress ( from the Greek eu = “ good ” ) , is a good kind of stress associated with positive feelings , optimal health , and performance .",1
14457,A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging situations .,0
14458,"As previously stated , scientific interest in stress goes back nearly a century .",0
14459,"One of the early pioneers in the study of stress was Walter Cannon , an eminent American physiologist at Harvard Medical School ( [ link ] ) .",0
14460,"In the early part of the 20th century , Cannon was the first to identify the body ’s physiological reactions to stress .",0
14461,"These physiological reactions were nonspecific , which means that regardless of the type of stressor , the same pattern of reactions would occur .",0
14462,"What Selye discovered was the general adaptation syndrome , the body ’s nonspecific physiological response to stress .",1
14463,"If exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time , the stage of exhaustion ensues .",0
14464,"At this stage , the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor : the body ’s ability to resist becomes depleted as physical wear takes its toll on the body ’s tissues and organs .",1
14465,"In short bursts , this process can have some favorable effects , such as providing extra energy , improving immune system functioning temporarily , and decreasing pain sensitivity .",0
14466,"However , extended release of cortisol — as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress — often comes at a high price .",0
14467,"For an individual to experience stress , he must first encounter a potential stressor .",0
14468,"In general , stressors can be placed into one of two broad categories : chronic and acute .",0
14469,The Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) uses the correlational research method to identify the connection between stress and health .,1
14470,"That is , respondents’ LCU scores are correlated with the number or frequency of self - reported symptoms indicating health problems .",0
14471,"Some people who are exposed to chronically stressful work conditions can experience job burnout , which is a general sense of emotional exhaustion and cynicism in relation to one ’s job ( Maslach & Jackson , 1981 ) .",1
14472,"Job burnout occurs frequently among those in human service jobs ( e.g. , social workers , teachers , therapists , and police officers ) .",0
14473,"In cases of comorbidity , the best treatment is thought to address both ( or multiple ) disorders simultaneously ( NIDA , 2012 ) .",0
14474,"Behavior therapies are used to treat comorbid conditions , and in many cases , psychotropic medications are used along with psychotherapy .",0
14475,"In a sense , the immune system is the body ’s surveillance system .",0
14476,"It consists of a variety of structures , cells , and mechanisms that serve to protect the body from invading toxins and microorganisms that can harm or damage the body ’s tissues and organs .",0
14477,"Also , we noted earlier that stress hormones released during hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis activation can adversely impact immune function .",0
14478,"One way they do this is by inhibiting the production of lymphocytes , white blood cells that circulate in the body ’s fluids that are important in the immune response ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .",1
14479,"A major risk factor for heart disease is hypertension , which is high blood pressure .",1
14480,"Hypertension forces a person ’s heart to pump harder , thus putting more physical strain on the heart .",0
14481,"In addition to anger and hostility , a number of other negative emotional states have been linked with heart disease , including negative affectivity and depression ( Suls & Bunde , 2005 ) .",0
14482,"Negative affectivity is a tendency to experience distressed emotional states involving anger , contempt , disgust , guilt , fear , and nervousness ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) .",1
14483,It has been linked with the development of both hypertension and heart disease .,0
14484,"Once a person seeks treatment , whether voluntarily or involuntarily , he has an intake done to assess his clinical needs .",0
14485,An intake is the therapist ’s first meeting with the client .,1
14486,"In group therapy , a clinician meets together with several clients with similar problems ( [ link ] ) .",1
14487,"When children are placed in group therapy , it is particularly important to match clients for age and problems .",0
14488,There are several different types of family therapy .,0
14489,"In structural family therapy , the therapist examines and discusses the boundaries and structure of the family : who makes the rules , who sleeps in the bed with whom , how decisions are made , and what are the boundaries within the family .",1
14490,"In some families , the parents do not work together to make rules , or one parent may undermine the other , leading the children to act out .",0
14491,"In modern practice , it has evolved ino what is known as psychodynamic therapy , which will be discussed later .",0
14492,Biomedical therapy involves medication and/or medical procedures to treat psychological disorders .,1
14493,"First , we will explore the various psychotherapeutic orientations outlined in [ link ] ( many of these orientations were discussed in the Introduction chapter ) .",0
14494,"Consequently , a patient would demonstrate resistance to recalling these thoughts or situations .",0
14495,"In dream analysis , a therapist interprets the underlying meaning of dreams .",1
14496,Play therapy is often used with children since they are not likely to sit on a couch and recall their dreams or engage in traditional talk therapy .,0
14497,"This technique uses a therapeutic process of play to “ help clients prevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth ” ( O’Connor , 2000 , p. 7 ) .",1
14498,One commonly used classical conditioning therapeutic technique is counterconditioning : a client learns a new response to a stimulus that has previously elicited an undesirable behavior .,1
14499,Two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy .,0
14500,"Thirty years later , Joseph Wolpe ( 1958 ) refined Jones ’s techniques , giving us the behavior therapy technique of exposure therapy that is used today .",0
14501,"A popular form of exposure therapy is systematic desensitization , wherein a calm and pleasant state is gradually associated with increasing levels of anxiety - inducing stimuli .",1
14502,The idea is that you ca n’t be nervous and relaxed at the same time .,0
14503,Cognitive therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on how a person ’s thoughts lead to feelings of distress .,1
14504,The idea behind cognitive therapy is that how you think determines how you feel and act .,0
14505,"One of the first forms of cognitive - behavioral therapy was rational emotive therapy ( RET ) , which was founded by Albert Ellis and grew out of his dislike of Freudian psychoanalysis ( Daniel , n.d . ) .",0
14506,"Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis ’s therapeutic approach ( National Association of Cognitive - Behavioral Therapists , 2009).Cognitive - behavioral therapy ( CBT ) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior .",1
14507,It aims to change cognitive distortions and self - defeating behaviors .,0
14508,Rogers ( 1951 ) felt that the term patient suggested the person seeking help was sick and looking for a cure .,0
14509,"Since this is a form of nondirective therapy , a therapeutic approach in which the therapist does not give advice or provide interpretations but helps the person to identify conflicts and understand feelings , Rogers ( 1951 ) emphasized the importance of the person taking control of his own life to overcome life ’s challenges .",1
14510,"Another biologically based treatment that continues to be used , although infrequently , is electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) ( formerly known by its unscientific name as electroshock therapy ) .",0
14511,It involves using an electrical current to induce seizures to help alleviate the effects of severe depression .,1
14512,"As an example , suppose Bradford receives a midterm notice that he is failing statistics class .",0
14513,"If Bradford adopts a problem - focused coping approach to managing his stress , he would be proactive in trying to alleviate the source of the stress .",0
14514,"He might contact his professor to discuss what must be done to raise his grade , he might also decide to set aside two hours daily to study statistics assignments , and he may seek tutoring assistance .",0
14515,Seligman believed that the dogs who failed to try to escape the later shocks were demonstrating learned helplessness : They had acquired a belief that they were powerless to do anything about the noxious stimulation they were receiving .,1
14516,Seligman also believed that the passivity and lack of initiative these dogs demonstrated was similar to that observed in human depression .,0
14517,Their review is aimed at determining which coping strategies are most effective at offsetting negative health outcomes associated with racism - related stress .,0
14518,"The authors examine the effectiveness of three coping strategies : focusing on racial identity to handle race - related stress , anger expression / suppression , and seeking social support .",0
14519,"You ’ve learned a bit about social support , so we ’ll focus the remainder of this discussion on the potential coping strategies of focusing on racial identity and anger expression / suppression . Focusing on racial identity refers to the process by which a person comes to feel as if he belongs to a given racial group ; this may increase a sense of pride associated with group membership .",0
14520,"In the 1970s , Herbert Benson , a cardiologist , developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique ( Greenberg , 2006 ) .",0
14521,"The relaxation response technique combines relaxation with transcendental meditation , and consists of four components ( Stein , 2001 ) :",1
14522,"For practical purposes , a precise definition of happiness might incorporate each of these elements : an enduring state of mind consisting of joy , contentment , and other positive emotions , plus the sense that one ’s life has meaning and value ( Lyubomirsky , 2001 ) .",1
14523,The definition implies that happiness is a long - term state — what is often characterized as subjective well - being — rather than merely a transient positive mood we all experience from time to time .,0
14524,"In deliberately setting out to create a new direction and new orientation for psychology , Seligman helped establish a growing movement and field of research called positive psychology ( Compton , 2005 ) .",0
14525,"In a very general sense , positive psychology can be thought of as the science of happiness ; it is an area of study that seeks to identify and promote those qualities that lead to greater fulfillment in our lives .",1
14526,"This field looks at people ’s strengths and what helps individuals to lead happy , contented lives , and it moves away from focusing on people ’s pathology , faults , and problems .",0
14527,Another factor that seems to be important in fostering a deep sense of well - being is the ability to derive flow from the things we do in life .,0
14528,"Flow is described as a particular experience that is so engaging and engrossing that it becomes worth doing for its own sake ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ) .",1
14529,"It is usually related to creative endeavors and leisure activities , but it can also be experienced by workers who like their jobs or students who love studying ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1999 ) .",0
14530,"In the 19th century , Dorothea Dix led reform efforts for mental health care in the United States ( [ link ] ) .",0
14531,"She investigated how those who are mentally ill and poor were cared for , and she discovered an underfunded and unregulated system that perpetuated abuse of this population ( Tiffany , 1891 ) .",0
14532,Other individuals might voluntarily seek treatment .,0
14533,Voluntary treatment means the person chooses to attend therapy to obtain relief from symptoms .,1
14534,"He called this condition early infantile autism , and it was characterized mainly by an inability to form close emotional ties with others , speech and language abnormalities , repetitive behaviors , and an intolerance of minor changes in the environment and in normal routines ( Bregman , 2005 ) .",1
14535,"What the DSM-5 refers to as autism spectrum disorder today , is a direct extension of Kanner ’s work .",0
14536,"Dissociative disorders are characterized by an individual becoming split off , or dissociated , from her core sense of self .",1
14537,"Although displacement is described in terms of direction , distance is not .",0
14538,Distance is defined to be the magnitude or size of displacement between two positions .,1
14539,Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them .,0
14540,"Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air , subject to only the acceleration of gravity .",1
14541,"The object is called a projectile , and its path is called its trajectory . The motion of falling objects , as covered in Problem - Solving Basics for One - Dimensional Kinematics , is a simple one - dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement .",0
14542,Dynamics is the study of the forces that cause objects and systems to move .,1
14543,"To understand this , we need a working definition of force .",0
14544,Section SummaryDynamics is the study of how forces affect the motion of objects .,1
14545,External forces are any outside forces that act on a body .,1
14546,A free - body diagram is a drawing of all external forces acting on a body .,1
14547,What do we mean by an external force ?,0
14548,An intuitive notion of external is correct — an external force acts from outside the system of interest .,1
14549,"For example , in [ link](a ) the system of interest is the wagon plus the child in it .",0
14550,"Numerous common experiences , such as stubbing a toe or throwing a ball , confirm this .",0
14551,It is precisely stated in Newton ’s third law of motion .,0
14552,Newton ’s Third Law of Motion,0
14553,A thrust is a reaction force that pushes a body forward in response to a backward force .,1
14554,"Rockets , airplanes , and cars are pushed forward by a thrust reaction force .",0
14555,"In Earth ’s frame this looks like a westward force on the satellite , or it can be interpreted as a violation of Newton ’s first law ( the law of inertia ) .",1
14556,"An inertial frame of reference is one in which all forces are real and , equivalently , one in which Newton ’s laws have the simple forms given in this chapter . Earth ’s rotation is slow enough that Earth is nearly an inertial frame .",0
14557,"You ordinarily must perform precise experiments to observe fictitious forces and the slight departures from Newton ’s laws , such as the effect just described .",0
14558,"If a bulldozer pushes a car into a wall , the car will not move but it will noticeably change shape .",0
14559,A change in shape due to the application of a force is a deformation .,1
14560,Even very small forces are known to cause some deformation .,0
14561,{ } Recall that the direction of acac size 12{a rSub { size 8{c } } } { } is toward the center .,0
14562,"You may use whichever expression is more convenient , as illustrated in examples below . A centrifuge ( see [ link]b ) is a rotating device used to separate specimens of different densities .",1
14563,"High centripetal acceleration significantly decreases the time it takes for separation to occur , and makes separation possible with small samples .",0

14793,The anti - gay marriage movement is an example of diagnostic framing with its uncompromising insistence that marriage is only between a man and a woman .,1
14794,"Prognostic framing , the second type , offers a solution and states how it will be implemented .",1
14795,"Some examples of this frame , when looking at the issue of marriage equality as framed by the anti - gay marriage movement , include the plan to restrict marriage to “ one man / one woman ” or to allow only “ civil unions ” instead of marriages .",0
14796,"New social movement theory , a development of European social scientists in the 1950s and 1960s , attempts to explain the proliferation of postindustrial and postmodern movements that are difficult to analyze using traditional social movement theories .",1
14797,"Rather than being one specific theory , it is more of a perspective that revolves around understanding movements as they relate to politics , identity , culture , and social change .",0
14798,"Modernization describes the processes that increase the amount of specialization and differentiation of structure in societies resulting in the move from an undeveloped society to a developed , technologically driven society ( Irwin 1975 ) .",1
14799,"By this definition , the level of modernity within a society is judged by the sophistication of its technology , particularly as it relates to infrastructure , industry , and the like .",0
14800,Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society .,1
14801,"Sociologists working from the micro - level study small groups and individual interactions , while those using macro - level analysis look at trends among and between large groups and societies .",0
14802,"For example , a micro - level study might look at the accepted rules of conversation in various groups such as among teenagers or business professionals .",0
14803,"Remember , though , that culture is a product of the people in a society ; sociologists take care not to treat the concept of “ culture ” as though it were alive in its own right .",1
14804,"Reification is an error of treating an abstract concept as though it has a real , material existence ( Sahn 2013 ) .",1
14805,"In seeking verstehen , outside observers of a social world — an entire culture or a small setting — attempt to understand it from an insider ’s point of view . In his book The Nature of Social Action ( 1922 ) , Weber described sociology as striving to """" interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds and the effects it produces . """"",1
14806,"He and other like - minded sociologists proposed a philosophy of antipositivism whereby social researchers would strive for subjectivity as they worked to represent social processes , cultural norms , and societal values .",1
14807,"This approach led to some research methods whose aim was not to generalize or predict ( traditional in science ) , but to systematically gain an in - depth understanding of social worlds .",0
14808,"Sociologists study social events , interactions , and patterns , and they develop a theory in an attempt to explain why things work as they do .",1
14809,"In sociology , a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create a testable proposition , called a hypothesis , about society ( Allan 2006 ) .",1
14810,"Classic sociological theories are still considered important and current , but new sociological theories build upon the work of their predecessors and add to them ( Calhoun 2002).In sociology , a few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social life , and these are called paradigms .",1
14811,"Paradigms are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate theories , generalizations , and the experiments performed in support of them .",0
14812,"Three paradigms have come to dominate sociological thinking , because they provide useful explanations : structural functionalism , conflict theory , and symbolic interactionism .",0
14813,"He believed that to study society , a sociologist must look beyond individuals to social facts such as laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashion , and rituals , which all serve to govern social life .",0
14814,"Alfred Radcliffe - Brown ( 1881–1955 ) defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole , and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity ( Radcliffe - Brown 1952 ) .",0
14815,"In a healthy society , all parts work together to maintain stability , a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as Parsons ( 1961 ) .",1
14816,"Another noted structural functionalist , Robert Merton ( 1910–2003 ) , pointed out that social processes often have many functions .",0
14817,"Manifest functions are the consequences of a social process that are sought or anticipated , while latent functions are the unsought consequences of a social process .",1
14818,"A manifest function of college education , for example , includes gaining knowledge , preparing for a career , and finding a good job that utilizes that education .",0
14819,conflict theory has been criticized because it tends to focus on conflict to the exclusion of recognizing stability .,0
14820,Many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually progressed over time rather than changing abruptly as conflict theory would suggest . Symbolic Interactionist TheorySymbolic interactionism is a micro - level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within a society .,1
14821,Communication — the exchange of meaning through language and symbols — is believed to be the way in which people make sense of their social worlds .,1
14822,"Sociological research attempts to answer a vast variety of questions , such as these and more , about our social world . We often have opinions about social situations , but these may be biased by our expectations or based on limited data .",0
14823,"Instead , scientific research is based on empirical evidence , which is evidence that comes from direct experience , scientifically gathered data , or experimentation .",1
14824,"Many people believe , for example , that crime rates go up when there ’s a full moon , but research does n’t support this opinion .",0
14825,"A hypothesis is a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables ; it ’s a possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances , as well as among various groups or in different places .",1
14826,"Sociologists use empirical data and the scientific method , or an interpretative framework , to increase understanding of societies and social interactions , but research begins with the search for an answer to a question .",0
14827,"Sociologists do not rule out any topic , but would strive to frame these questions in better research terms . That is why sociologists are careful to define their terms .",0
14828,"In a hygiene study , for instance , hygiene could be defined as “ personal habits to maintain physical appearance ( as opposed to health ) , ” and a researcher might ask , “ How do differing personal hygiene habits reflect the cultural value placed on appearance ? ” When forming these basic research questions , sociologists develop an operational definition , that is , they define the concept in terms of the physical or concrete steps it takes to objectively measure it .",1
14829,The operational definition identifies an observable condition of the concept .,0
14830,"In sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another .",0
14831,"In research , independent variables are the cause of the change .",1
14832,"The dependent variable is the effect , or thing that is changed .",1
14833,"A researcher would n’t stroll into a crime - ridden neighborhood at midnight , calling out , “ Any gang members around ? ” And if a researcher walked into a coffee shop and told the employees they would be observed as part of a study on work efficiency , the self - conscious , intimidated baristas might not behave naturally .",0
14834,This is called the Hawthorne effect — where people change their behavior because they know they are being watched as part of a study .,1
14835,The Hawthorne effect is unavoidable in some research .,0
14836,"Surveys can track preferences for presidential candidates or reported individual behaviors ( such as sleeping , driving , or texting habits ) or factual information such as employment status , income , and education levels .",0
14837,"A survey targets a specific population , people who are the focus of a study , such as college athletes , international students , or teenagers living with type 1 ( juvenile - onset ) diabetes .",1
14838,"Most researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population , or a sample : that is , a manageable number of subjects who represent a larger population .",1
14839,"For some topics , the researcher might ask yes - or - no or multiple - choice questions , allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question .",0
14840,This kind of quantitative data — research collected in numerical form that can be counted — are easy to tabulate .,1
14841,"Just count up the number of “ yes ” and “ no ” responses or correct answers , and chart them into percentages . Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers — beyond “ yes , ” “ no , ” or the option next to a checkbox .",0
14842,"They meet subjects where they live , work , and play .",0
14843,Field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment without doing a lab experiment or a survey .,1
14844,It is a research method suited to an interpretive framework rather than to the scientific method .,0
14845,Ethnography is the extended observation of the social perspective and cultural values of an entire social setting .,1
14846,Ethnographies involve objective observation of an entire community .,0
14847,"While sociologists often engage in original research studies , they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through secondary data analysis .",0
14848,"Secondary data does n’t result from firsthand research collected from primary sources , but are the already completed work of other researchers .",1
14849,The ASA is a great resource for students of sociology as well .,0
14850,The ASA maintains a code of ethics — formal guidelines for conducting sociological research — consisting of principles and ethical standards to be used in the discipline .,1
14851,"It also describes procedures for filing , investigating , and resolving complaints of unethical conduct .",0
14852,"In everyday conversation , people rarely distinguish between the terms culture and society , but the terms have slightly different meanings , and the distinction is important to a sociologist .",0
14853,A society describes a group of people who share a community and a culture .,1
14854,"By “ community , ” sociologists refer to a definable region — as small as a neighborhood ( Brooklyn , or “ the east side of town ” ) , as large as a country ( Ethiopia , the United States , or Nepal ) , or somewhere in between ( in the United States , this might include someone who identifies with Southern or Midwestern society ) .",1
14855,"cultural imperialism , the deliberate imposition of one ’s own cultural values on another culture .",1
14856,"Europe ’s colonial expansion , begun in the sixteenth century , was often accompanied by a severe cultural imperialism .",0
14857,"Values often suggest how people should behave , but they do n’t accurately reflect how people do behave .",0
14858,"Values portray an ideal culture , the standards society would like to embrace and live up to .",1
14859,"But ideal culture differs from real culture , the way society actually is , based on what occurs and exists .",0
14860,"People sanction certain behaviors by giving their support , approval , or permission , or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and nonsupport .",0
14861,"Sanctions are a form of social control , a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms .",1
14862,"Sometimes people conform to norms in anticipation or expectation of positive sanctions : good grades , for instance , may mean praise from parents and teachers .",0
14863,"There are plenty of formal norms , but the list of informal norms — casual behaviors that are generally and widely conformed to — is longer .",1
14864,"People learn informal norms by observation , imitation , and general socialization .",0
14865,"Humans , consciously and subconsciously , are always striving to make sense of their surrounding world .",0
14866,"Symbols — such as gestures , signs , objects , signals , and words — help people understand that world .",0
14867,They provide clues to understanding experiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies .,1
14868,"In each pair , one type of entertainment is considered high - brow and the other low - brow .",0
14869,Sociologists use the term high culture to describe the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in the highest class segments of a society .,1
14870,"People often associate high culture with intellectualism , political power , and prestige .",0
14871,"Sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures , which are a type of subculture that rejects some of the larger culture ’s norms and values .",1
14872,"In contrast to subcultures , which operate relatively smoothly within the larger society , countercultures might actively defy larger society by developing their own set of rules and norms to live by , sometimes even creating communities that operate outside of greater society .",0
14873,Inventions result when something new is formed from existing objects or concepts — when things are put together in an entirely new manner .,1
14874,"In the late 1800s and early 1900s , electric appliances were invented at an astonishing pace .",0
14875,"Today , many U.S. companies set up offices in other nations where the costs of resources and labor are cheaper .",0
14876,"When a person in the United States calls to get information about banking , insurance , or computer services , the person taking that call may be working in another country . Alongside the process of globalization is diffusion , or the spread of material and nonmaterial culture .",1
14877,"While globalization refers to the integration of markets , diffusion relates to a similar process in the integration of international cultures .",1
14878,"Roughly 7,500 years ago , human societies began to recognize their ability to tame and breed animals and to grow and cultivate their own plants .",0
14879,"Pastoral societies , such as the Maasai villagers , rely on the domestication of animals as a resource for survival .",1
14880,"Unlike earlier hunter - gatherers who depended entirely on existing resources to stay alive , pastoral groups were able to breed livestock for food , clothing , and transportation , and they created a surplus of goods .",1
14881,The ninth century gave rise to feudal societies .,0
14882,These societies contained a strict hierarchical system of power based around land ownership and protection .,1
14883,He asserted that individual behavior was not the same as collective behavior and that studying collective behavior was quite different from studying an individual ’s actions .,0
14884,"Durkheim called the communal beliefs , morals , and attitudes of a society the collective conscience .",1
14885,"In his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ If I do not submit to the conventions of society , if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class , the ridicule I provoke , the social isolation in which I am kept , produce , although in an attenuated form , the same effects as punishment ” ( Durkheim 1895 ) .",0
14886,"This type of thinking was common in preindustrial societies where strong bonds of kinship and a low division of labor created shared morals and values among people , such as hunter - gatherer groups .",0
14887,"When people tend to do the same type of work , Durkheim argued , they tend to think and act alike . In industrial societies , mechanical solidarity is replaced with organic solidarity , which is social order based around an acceptance of economic and social differences .",1
14888,"In capitalist societies , Durkheim wrote , division of labor becomes so specialized that everyone is doing different things .",0
14889,"Marx ’s colleague and friend , Frederick Engels , wrote The Condition of the Working - Class in England in 1844 , which described in detail the horrid conditions . Such is the Old Town of Manchester , and on re - reading my description , I am forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated , it is far from black enough to convey a true impression of the filth , ruin , and uninhabitableness , the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness , ventilation , and health which characterise the construction of this single district , containing at least twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants .",0
14890,"And such a district exists in the heart of the second city of England , the first manufacturing city of the world . Add to that the long hours , the use of child labor , and exposure to extreme conditions of heat , cold , and toxic chemicals , and it is no wonder that Marx and Engels referred to capitalism , which is a way of organizing an economy so that the things that are used to make and transport products ( such as land , oil , factories , ships , etc . )",1
14891,"are owned by individual people and companies rather than by the government , as the “ dictatorship of the bourgeoisie . ” Karl Marx ( left ) and Friedrich Engels ( right ) analyzed differences in social power between “ have ” and “ have - not ” groups .",0
14892,"In order for society to overcome false consciousness , Marx proposed that it be replaced with class consciousness , the awareness of one ’s rank in society .",1
14893,"Instead of existing as a “ class in itself , ” the proletariat must become a “ class for itself ” in order to produce social change ( Marx and Engels 1848 ) , meaning that instead of just being an inert strata of society , the class could become an advocate for social improvements .",1
14894,In 1966 sociologists Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann wrote a book called The Social Construction of Reality .,0
14895,"In it , they argued that society is created by humans and human interaction , which they call habitualization .",0
14896,"Habitualization describes how “ any action that is repeated frequently becomes cast into a pattern , which can then be … performed again in the future in the same manner and with the same economical effort ” ( Berger and Luckmann 1966 ) .",1
14897,"That is , people ’s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality .",0
14898,"For example , a teenager who is repeatedly given a label — overachiever , player , bum — might live up to the term even though it initially was n’t a part of his character . Like Berger and Luckmann in their description of habitualization , Thomas states that our moral codes and social norms are created by “ successive definitions of the situation . ” This concept is defined by sociologist Robert K. Merton as a self - fulfilling prophecy .",0
14899,"Merton explains that with a self - fulfilling prophecy , even a false idea can become true if it is acted upon .",0
14900,Sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their rank and role in society .,1
14901,"Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .",1
14902,"Others , called achieved statuses , are obtained by choice , such as a high school dropout , self - made millionaire , or nurse .",1
14903,"Even a single status such as “ student ” has a complex role - set , or array of roles , attached to it ( Merton 1957 ) .",0
14904,"If too much is required of a single role , individuals can experience role strain .",1
14905,"Consider the duties of a parent : cooking , cleaning , driving , problem - solving , acting as a source of moral guidance — the list goes on .",0
14906,Goffman ’s dramaturgy ideas expand on the ideas of Charles Cooley and the looking - glass self .,0
14907,"According to Cooley , we base our image on what we think other people see ( Cooley 1902 ) .",0
14908,"A refugee is defined as an individual who has been forced to leave his or her country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster , while asylum - seekers are those whose claim to refugee status has not been validated .",1
14909,"An internally displaced person , on the other hand , is neither a refugee nor an asylum - seeker .",1
14910,Displaced persons have fled their homes while remaining inside their country ’s borders .,1
14911,"Simultaneously , this dynamic contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use , like petroleum , which sequentially increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions . As the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm , those who could afford it turned to the exurbs , communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute .",0
14912,"Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .",1
14913,"New York was the first U.S. megalopolis , a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs .",1
14914,"As cities evolve from manufacturing - based industrial to service- and information - based postindustrial societies , gentrification becomes more common .",0
14915,Gentrification occurs when members of the middle and upper classes enter and renovate city areas that have been historically less affluent while the poor urban underclass are forced by resulting price pressures to leave those neighborhoods for increasingly decaying portions of the city .,1
14916,"Globally , 54 percent of the world ’s 7 billion people currently reside in urban areas , with the most urbanized region being North America ( 82 percent ) , followed by Latin America / the Caribbean ( 80 percent ) , with Europe coming in third ( 72 percent ) .",0
14917,"The challenge for a human ecologist working in U.S. urban planning is to design landscapes and waterscapes with natural beauty , while also figuring out how to provide for free - flowing transport of innumerable vehicles , not to mention parking !",0
14918,The concentric zone model ( Burgess 1925 ) is perhaps the most famous example of human ecology .,0
14919,"This model views a city as a series of concentric circular areas , expanding outward from the center of the city , with various “ zones ” invading adjacent zones ( as new categories of people and businesses overrun the edges of nearby zones ) and succeeding ( then after invasion , the new inhabitants repurpose the areas they have invaded and push out the previous inhabitants ) .",1
14920,"The GCCI is a United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) funding program intended to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of peripheral and semi - peripheral countries by encouraging the use of alternative , low - carbon , energy sources with financial incentives .",0
14921,"Programming is organized around three pillars : ( 1 ) climate change adaptation , ( 2 ) clean energy , and ( 3 ) sustainable landscapes ( Troilo 2012).PollutionPollution describes what happens when contaminants are introduced into an environment ( water , air , land ) at levels that are damaging .",1
14922,"Environments can often sustain a limited amount of contaminants without marked change , and water , air , and soil can “ heal ” themselves to a certain degree .",0
14923,"Environmental racism refers to the way in which minority group neighborhoods ( populated primarily by people of color and members of low socioeconomic groups ) are burdened with a disproportionate number of hazards , including toxic waste facilities , garbage dumps , and other sources of environmental pollution and foul odors that lower the quality of life .",1
14924,"All around the globe , members of minority groups bear a greater burden of the health problems that result from higher exposure to waste and pollution .",0
14925,"To explore these questions , we turn to demography , or the study of populations .",1
14926,"Three of the most important components that affect the issues above are fertility , mortality , and migration . The fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born .",1
14927,"The fertility number is generally lower than the fecundity number , which measures the potential number of children that could be born to women of childbearing age .",1
14928,"This number can be measured for societies , nations , world regions , or other groups .",0
14929,"The population composition includes the sex ratio , the number of men for every hundred women , as well as the population pyramid , a picture of population distribution by sex and age ( [ link]).This population pyramid shows the breakdown of the 2010 U.S. population according to age and sex .",1

14931,"Of course , some theories are less focused on the pessimistic hypothesis that the world ’s population will meet a detrimental challenge to sustaining itself .",0
14932,Cornucopian theory scoffs at the idea of humans wiping themselves out ; it asserts that human ingenuity can resolve any environmental or social issues that develop .,1
14933,"As an example , it points to the issue of food supply .",0
14934,They learn to understand interactions involving different people with a variety of purposes .,0
14935,"For example , a child at this stage is likely to be aware of the different responsibilities of people in a restaurant who together make for a smooth dining experience ( someone seats you , another takes your order , someone else cooks the food , while yet another clears away dirty dishes).Finally , children develop , understand , and learn the idea of the generalized other , the common behavioral expectations of general society .",0
14936,"By this stage of development , an individual is able to imagine how he or she is viewed by one or many others — and thus , from a sociological perspective , to have a “ self ” ( Mead 1934 ; Mead 1964).Kohlberg ’s Theory of Moral Development",1
14937,"According to this belief , our temperaments , interests , and talents are set before birth .",0
14938,"From this perspective , then , who we are depends on nature .",0
14939,"In the process of resocialization , old behaviors that were helpful in a previous role are removed because they are no longer of use .",1
14940,"Resocialization is necessary when a person moves to a senior care center , goes to boarding school , or serves time in jail .",0
14941,"School and classroom rituals , led by teachers serving as role models and leaders , regularly reinforce what society expects from children .",1
14942,"Sociologists describe this aspect of schools as the hidden curriculum , the informal teaching done by schools .",1
14943,"A rally is usually a one - time event , for instance , and belonging to a political party does n’t imply interaction with others .",0
14944,"People who exist in the same place at the same time but who do not interact or share a sense of identity — such as a bunch of people standing in line at Starbucks — are considered an aggregate , or a crowd .",1
14945,Another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way .,0
14946,The primary group is usually fairly small and is made up of individuals who generally engage face - to - face in long - term emotional ways .,1
14947,This group serves emotional needs : expressive functions rather than pragmatic ones .,0
14948,"The primary group is usually made up of significant others , those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization .",0
14949,A reference group is a group that people compare themselves to — it provides a standard of measurement .,1
14950,"In U.S. society , peer groups are common reference groups .",0
14951,"Other secondary groups , like a workplace or a classroom , also have formal leaders , but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly . Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader .",1
14952,An instrumental leader is one who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks .,1
14953,We can imagine that an army general or a Fortune 500 CEO would be an instrumental leader .,0
14954,"Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership . In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles .",0
14955,Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making .,1
14956,They work hard to build consensus before choosing a course of action and moving forward .,0
14957,She would n’t want people to think she was too poor to find proper clothes .,0
14958,Conformity is the extent to which an individual complies with group norms or expectations .,1
14959,"As you might recall , we use reference groups to assess and understand how to act , to dress , and to behave .",0
14960,Sociologist Amitai Etzioni ( 1975 ) posited that formal organizations fall into three categories .,0
14961,"Normative organizations , also called voluntary organizations , are based on shared interests .",1
14962,"As the name suggests , joining them is voluntary and typically done because people find membership rewarding in an intangible way .",0
14963,A total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place .,1
14964,"The third type is utilitarian organizations , which , as the name suggests , are joined because of the need for a specific material reward .",1
14965,"High school and the workplace fall into this category — one joined in pursuit of a diploma , the other in order to make money .",0
14966,"The existence of explicit rules refers to the way in which rules are outlined , written down , and standardized .",1
14967,"For example , at your college or university , the student guidelines are contained within the Student Handbook .",0
14968,"While ostensibly based on meritocracy , bureaucracies can perpetuate the existing balance of power by only recognizing the merit in traditionally male and privileged paths .",0
14969,"Michels ( 1911 ) suggested that all large organizations are characterized by the Iron Rule of Oligarchy , wherein an entire organization is ruled by a few elites .",1
14970,Do you think this is true ?,0
14971,An adult belching loudly is avoided .,0
14972,"All societies practice social control , the regulation and enforcement of norms .",1
14973,"The underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order , an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society ’s members base their daily lives .",1
14974,Sanctions can be positive as well as negative .,0
14975,Positive sanctions are rewards given for conforming to norms .,1
14976,A promotion at work is a positive sanction for working hard .,0
14977,Informal sanctions emerge in face - to - face social interactions .,0
14978,"For example , wearing flip - flops to an opera or swearing loudly in church may draw disapproving looks or even verbal reprimands , whereas behavior that is seen as positive — such as helping an old man carry grocery bags across the street — may receive positive informal reactions , such as a smile or pat on the back . Formal sanctions , on the other hand , are ways to officially recognize and enforce norm violations .",1
14979,"If a student violates her college ’s code of conduct , for example , she might be expelled .",0
14980,Cultural deviance theory suggests that conformity to the prevailing cultural norms of lower - class society causes crime .,1
14981,Researchers Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay ( 1942 ) studied crime patterns in Chicago in the early 1900s .,0
14982,"In his book The Power Elite ( 1956 ) , sociologist C. Wright Mills described the existence of what he dubbed the power elite , a small group of wealthy and influential people at the top of society who hold the power and resources .",1
14983,"Wealthy executives , politicians , celebrities , and military leaders often have access to national and international power , and in some cases , their decisions affect everyone in society .",0
14984,"Individuals who engage in primary deviance still maintain a feeling of belonging in society and are likely to continue to conform to norms in the future . Sometimes , in more extreme cases , primary deviance can morph into secondary deviance .",0
14985,Secondary deviance occurs when a person ’s self - concept and behavior begin to change after his or her actions are labeled as deviant by members of society .,1
14986,The person may begin to take on and fulfill the role of a “ deviant ” as an act of rebellion against the society that has labeled that individual as such .,0
14987,"Although deviance is a violation of social norms , it ’s not always punishable , and it ’s not necessarily bad .",1
14988,"Crime , on the other hand , is a behavior that violates official law and is punishable through formal sanctions .",1

15037,"Powerful individuals and social institutions have a great deal of influence over which forms of technology are released , when and where they are released , and what kind of media is available for our consumption , which is a form of gatekeeping .",0
15038,Shoemaker and Vos ( 2009 ) define gatekeeping as the sorting process by which thousands of possible messages are shaped into a mass media - appropriate form and reduced to a manageable amount .,1
15039,"In other words , the people in charge of the media decide what the public is exposed to , which , as C. Wright Mills ( 1956 ) famously noted , is the heart of media ’s power .",0

15045,"To build a useful macroeconomic model , we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand for the economy , and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level .",1
15046,This model is called the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model .,0
15047,"This module will explain aggregate supply , aggregate demand , and the equilibrium between them .",0
15048,"If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising , but their costs of production are not rising , then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production . The slope of an AS curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right .",0
15049,"At the far left of the aggregate supply curve , the level of output in the economy is far below potential GDP , which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor , physical capital , and technology , in the context of its existing market and legal institutions .",1
15050,"At these relatively low levels of output , levels of unemployment are high , and many factories are running only part - time , or have closed their doors .",0
15051,"This demand is determined by a number of factors , but one of them is the price level — recall though , that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy .",1
15052,The aggregate demand ( AD ) curve shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level .,1
15053,[ link ] presents an aggregate demand ( AD ) curve .,0
15054,"Just like the aggregate supply curve , the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level .",0
15055,"In the long run , however , producers are limited to producing at potential GDP .",0
15056,"For this reason , what we have been calling the AS curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( SRAS ) curve .",0
15057,The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( LRAS ) curve .,0
15058,Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor .,1
15059,One measure of this is output per worker or GDP per capita .,0
15060,"Over time , productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output .",0
15061,The University of Michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month .,0
15062,"The survey results are then reported at http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu , which break down the change in consumer confidence among different income levels .",0
15063,The AD / AS model can be used to illustrate both Say ’s law that supply creates its own demand and Keynes’ law that demand creates its own supply .,0
15064,"Consider the three zones of the SRAS curve as identified in [ link ] : the Keynesian zone , the neoclassical zone , and the intermediate zone . Keynes , Neoclassical , and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply CurveNear the equilibrium Ek , in the Keynesian zone at the far left of the SRAS curve , small shifts in AD , either to the right or the left , will affect the output level Yk , but will not much affect the price level .",0
15065,"Finally , consider the intermediate zone of the SRAS curve in [ link ] .",0
15066,"If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei , then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions .",0
15067,"The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at Y1 in the [ link ] .",0
15068,"Keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in a recessionary gap , with its attendant unemployment , for a significant period of time . In the same way ( though not shown in the figure ) , if AD increases , the economy could experience an inflationary gap , where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output .",1
15069,"As a consequence , the economy experiences inflation .",0
15070,"Disposable income : For most people , the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how much income they have in their take - home pay , also known as disposable income , which is income after taxes .",1
15071,"Instead , prices and wages are “ sticky , ” making it difficult to restore the economy to full employment and potential GDP .",0
15072,Keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky : the coordination argument .,0
15073,"This argument points out that , even if most people would be willing — at least hypothetically — to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline , a market - oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions .",1
15074,A key concept in Keynesian economics is the expenditure multiplier .,0
15075,"The expenditure multiplier is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP , but that spending is powerful .",1
15076,"The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low , but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP , the economy is at greater risk for inflation .",0
15077,"Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation , which became known as a Phillips curve .",1
15078,"[ link ] shows a theoretical Phillips curve , and the following Work It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States .",0
15079,"Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy , such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment , or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right .",1
15080,"For example , if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in [ link ] , so that the economy was in recession , the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from ADr to ADf , where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment .",0
15081,This focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run .,0
15082,"Let 's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run",0
15083,One subset of neoclassical economists holds that the adjustment of wages and prices in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid indeed .,0
15084,"The theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can , using all information available to them .",1
15085,"In an economy where most people have rational expectations , economic adjustments may happen very quickly .",0
15086,"As inflation fluctuates , so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods .",0
15087,"The nominal interest rate is comprised of the real rate , plus an expected inflation factor .",1
15088,Expected inflation also tells economists about how the public views the direction of the economy .,0
15089,"Fighting Unemployment or Inflation?As explained in Unemployment , unemployment can be divided into two categories : cyclical unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment , which is the sum of frictional and structural unemployment .",1
15090,Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential GDP — giving potential employers less incentive to hire .,1
15091,"Each approach , Keynesian and neoclassical , has its strengths and weaknesses . The short - term Keynesian model , built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity , does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls .",1
15092,"By focusing on the short - run adjustments of aggregate demand , Keynesian economics risks overlooking the long - term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exists even when the economy is producing at potential GDP .",0
15093,The discussion of money and banking is a central component in the study of macroeconomics .,0
15094,"At this point , you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics !",0
15095,": economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation .",0
15096,We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals . You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( AD / AS ) model .,0
15097,Barter — literally trading one good or service for another — is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy .,1
15098,"In an economy without money , an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants , a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide .",1
15099,"For example , if an accountant wants a pair of shoes , this accountant must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services .",0
15100,This function of money does not require that money is a perfect store of value .,0
15101,"In an economy with inflation , money loses some buying power each year , but it remains money . Third , money serves as a unit of account , which means that it is the ruler by which other values are measured .",0
15102,"For example , an accountant may charge $ 100 to file your tax return .",0
15103,"Gold , silver , cowrie shells , cigarettes , and even cocoa beans have been used as money .",0
15104,"Although these items are used as commodity money , they also have a value from use as something other than money .",0
15105,"Gold , for example , has been used throughout the ages as money although today it is not used as money but rather is valued for its other attributes .",0
15106,"Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money , economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity .",0
15107,Liquidity refers to how quickly a financial asset can be used to buy a good or service .,1
15108,"For example , cash is very liquid .",0
15109,"M1 money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash , checkable ( demand ) deposits , and traveler ’s checks M2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , and money market funds . M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation — the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury , at the Federal Reserve Bank , or in bank vaults .",1
15110,"Closely related to currency are checkable deposits , also known as demand deposits .",0
15111,These are the amounts held in checking accounts .,1
15112,"Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .",1
15113,"Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ 100,000 ) certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , ranging from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate .",1
15114,"In short , all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend , but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1 [ link ] should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2 .",0
15115,"Until you pay the credit card bill , you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company .",0
15116,"With a smart card , you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases .",0
15117,"Some “ smart cards ” used for specific purposes , like long - distance phone calls or making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria , are not really all that smart , because they can only be used for certain purchases or in certain places . In short , credit cards , debit cards , and smart cards are different ways to move money when a purchase is made .",0
15118,"Also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date .",0
15119,Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to find someone to lend them cash Transaction costs are the costs associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money .,1
15120,"Thus , banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries — they bring savers and borrowers together .",0
15121,A credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run .,1
15122,Members of each credit union decide who is eligible to be a member .,0
15123,"If you own a home , this is also considered an asset .",0
15124,A liability is a debt or something you owe .,1
15125,Many people borrow money to buy homes .,0
15126,[ link ] illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank .,0
15127,"Because of the two - column format of the balance sheet , with the T - shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under “ Assets ” and “ Liabilities , ” it is sometimes called a T - account .",0
15128,These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an asset : The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future .,0
15129,"In our example , the Safe and Secure Bank holds bonds worth a total value of $ 4 million . The final entry under assets is reserves , which is money that the bank keeps on hand , and that is not loaned out or invested in bonds — and thus does not lead to interest payments .",1
15130,"The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors’ money on “ reserve , ” which means either in their vaults or kept at the Federal Reserve Bank .",0
15131,"The risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank ’s liabilities , namely the deposits of its customers , can be withdrawn quickly , but many of the bank ’s assets like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades . This asset - liability time mismatch — a bank ’s liabilities can be withdrawn in the short term while its assets are repaid in the long term — can cause severe problems for a bank .",0
15132,"For example , imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of money at a certain interest rate , but then sees interest rates rise substantially .",0
15133,"In making decisions about the money supply , a central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates and , in this way , to influence macroeconomic policy , whose goal is low unemployment and low inflation .",1
15134,The central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation ’s banking system to protect bank depositors and insure the health of the bank ’s balance sheet .,0
15135,The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors .,0
15136,"In early 2014 , Janet L. Yellen , shown in [ link ] became the first woman to hold this post .",0
15137,"Yellen has been described in the media as “ perhaps the most qualified Fed chair in history . ” With a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University , Yellen has taught macroeconomics at Harvard , the London School of Economics , and most recently at the University of California at Berkeley .",0
15138,"Regulation falls into a number of categories , including reserve requirements , capital requirements , and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make .",0
15139,"In Money and Banking , we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves .",0
15140,"“ On hand ” is a bit of a misnomer because , while a portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank , the majority are held in the bank ’s account at the Federal Reserve , and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors .",0
15141,"The National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ) supervises credit unions , which are nonprofit banks owned and run by their members .",1
15142,"There are over 6,000 credit unions in the U.S. economy , though the typical credit union is small compared to most banks . The Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions .",0
15143,"To protect against bank runs , Congress has put two strategies into place : deposit insurance and the lender of last resort .",0
15144,"Deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money , even if the bank goes bankrupt .",1
15145,The most important function of the Federal Reserve is to conduct the nation ’s monetary policy .,0
15146,"Article I , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power “ to coin money ” and “ to regulate the value thereof . ” As part of the 1913 legislation that created the Federal Reserve , Congress delegated these powers to the Fed .",0
15147,Where did the Federal Reserve get the $ 20 million that it used to purchase the bonds ?,0
15148,A central bank has the power to create money .,0
15149,"As a result of the Panic , the Federal Reserve was founded to be the “ lender of last resort . ” In the event of a bank run , sound banks , ( banks that were not bankrupt ) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed ’s discount “ window ” to quell the bank run . The interest rate banks pay for such loans is called the discount rate .",1
15150,( They are so named because loans are made against the bank ’s outstanding loans “ at a discount ” of their face value . ),0
15151,Recall that the specific interest rate the Fed targets is the federal funds rate .,1
15152,"The Federal Reserve has , since 1995 , established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations .",0
15153,[ link ] ( a ) illustrates this situation .,0
15154,This example uses a short - run upward - sloping Keynesian aggregate supply curve ( SRAS ) .,0
15155,The original equilibrium during a recession of E0 occurs at an output level of 600 .,0
15156,"In late 2008 , as the U.S. economy struggled with recession , the Federal Reserve had already reduced the interest rate to near - zero .",0
15157,"With the recession still ongoing , the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing ( QE ) .",0
15158,This is the purchase of long - term government and private mortgage - backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand .,1
15159,"Similarly , sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments .",0
15160,"The result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP .",0
15161,"Deflation occurs when the rate of inflation is negative ; that is , instead of money having less purchasing power over time , as occurs with inflation , money is worth more .",1
15162,Deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a recession .,0
15163,"If velocity is constant over time , then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left - hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in nominal GDP — although this change could happen through an increase in inflation , or an increase in real GDP , or some combination of the two .",0
15164,"If velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way , then changes in the money supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP .",0
15165,"By 2014 , central banks in 28 countries , including Austria , Brazil , Canada , Israel , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , Thailand , and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate .",0
15166,"A notable exception is the Federal Reserve in the United States , which does not practice inflation - targeting .",0
15167,"Instead , the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account . Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion .",0
15168,"For example , from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “ dot - com ” boom , the U.S. stock market , which is measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Index ( which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy ) , nearly tripled in value .",0
15169,"The Nasdaq index , which includes many smaller technology companies , increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000 .",0
15170,These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable .,0
15171,"The discussion in this chapter has focused on domestic monetary policy ; that is , the view of monetary policy within an economy .",1
15172,"Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows explores the international dimension of monetary policy , and how monetary policy becomes involved with exchange rates and international flows of financial capital . The Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound",0
15173,"With these exceptions duly noted , most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling , buying , hiring , borrowing , traveling , or investing across national borders .",0
15174,The market in which people or firms use one currency to purchase another currency is called the foreign exchange market .,1
15175,"Financial investments that cross international boundaries , and require exchanging currency , are often divided into two categories .",0
15176,"Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) refers to purchasing a firm ( at least ten percent ) in another country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example , in 2008 the Belgian beer - brewing company InBev bought the U.S. beer - maker Anheuser - Busch for $ 52 billion .",1
15177,"To make this purchase of a U.S. firm , InBev would have to supply euros ( the currency of Belgium ) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S. dollars .",0
15178,"Most people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank , and most banks provide foreign exchange as a service to customers .",1
15179,"These banks ( and a few other firms ) , known as dealers , then trade the foreign exchange .",0
15180,This is called the interbank market .,0
15181,"This means that when comparing the exchange rates between two countries ( in this case , the United States and Canada ) , the depreciation ( or weakening ) of one country ( the U.S. dollar for this example ) indicates the appreciation ( or strengthening ) of the other currency ( which in this example is the Canadian dollar ) .",1
15182,( Source : Federal Reserve Economic Data ( FRED ) ( a ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCAUS ; ( b ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CCUSSP01CAQ650N ) The bottom graph shows the exchange rate from U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars since 1980 .,0
15183,"This example shows how a stronger euro discourages exports by the French firm , because it makes the costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales revenues earned in another country .",0
15184,"From the point of view of the U.S. economy , the example also shows how a weaker U.S. dollar encourages exports .",0
15185,"Exchange rates would bounce around less , too .",0
15186,"The economist Milton Friedman ( 1912–2006 ) , for example , wrote a defense of floating exchange rates in 1962 in his book Capitalism and Freedom : Being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates .",0
15187,"When we support a free price system [ for goods and services ] at home , this does not imply that we favor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down .",0
15188,The Brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways .,0
15189,One approach is to use an expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates .,0
15190,"In foreign exchange markets , the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to depreciation .",0
15191,"When a country decides to alter the market exchange rate , it faces a number of tradeoffs .",0
15192,"If it uses monetary policy to alter the exchange rate , it then can not at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession .",0
15193,"If it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates , then it must face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency .",0
15194,"If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like U.S. dollars or euros , to hold as reserves .",0
15195,"Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost , and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit .",0
15196,"Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes , named after James Tobin , the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture .",1
15197,"For example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term portfolio investment while exempting long - term foreign direct investment .",0
15198,Countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from a country .,0
15199,The choice depends both on how well a nation ’s central bank can implement a specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation ’s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate policies .,0
15200,"A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth , low inflation , low unemployment , and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy ; conversely , no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals .",0
15201,"On the other hand , a merged currency applied across wide geographic and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems , such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent monetary policies .",0
15202,"Government spending covers a range of services provided by the federal , state , and local governments .",0
15203,"When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year , it runs a budget deficit .",1
15204,"Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .",1
15205,"Taxes also vary with marital status , family size , and other factors .",0
15206,"The marginal tax rates ( the tax that must be paid on all yearly income ) for a single taxpayer range from 10 % to 35 % , depending on income , as the following Clear It Up feature explains .",1
15207,"The third - largest source of federal tax revenue , as shown in [ link ] is the corporate income tax .",0
15208,"The common name for corporate income is “ profits . ” Over time , corporate income tax receipts have declined as a share of GDP , from about 4 % in the 1960s to an average of 1 % to 2 % of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s .",0
15209,"Having discussed the revenue ( taxes ) and expense ( spending ) side of the budget , we now turn to the annual budget deficit or surplus , which is the difference between the tax revenue collected and spending over a fiscal year , which starts October 1 and ends September 30 of the next year .",0
15210,"Even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates , fiscal policy can end up being less powerful than was originally expected .",0
15211,"This is referred to as crowding out , where government borrowing and spending results in higher interest rates , which reduces business investment and household consumption .",1
15212,"Finally , once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs .",0
15213,The time to get the projects started is often called the implementation lag .,1
15214,"At this point , you may wonder about the Federal Reserve .",0
15215,"After all , can the Federal Reserve not use expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates , or in this case , to prevent interest rates from rising ?",0
15216,Other government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the K–12 education system .,0
15217,"Programs for early childhood education , like the federal Head Start program , are directed at families where the parents may have limited educational and financial resources .",0
15218,Government also offers substantial support for universities and colleges .,0
15219,"If the funding for a larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors , then a budget deficit may be accompanied by a trade deficit .",0
15220,"In some countries , this pattern of a twin deficits has set the stage for international financial investors first to send their funds to a country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and then to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange rate and a financial crisis as well .",0
15221,It depends on whether funding comes from international financial investors .,0
15222,"The differences in economic statistics and other measures of well - being , substantial though they are , do not fully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries .",0
15223,"Aside from the neoclassical determinants of growth , four additional determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and are worth mentioning : geography , demography , industrial structure , and institutions . Geographic and Demographic Differences",0
15224,"This combination of technology , human capital , and physical capital , combined with the incentives of a market - oriented economic context , proved an extremely powerful stimulant to growth .",0
15225,Challenges faced by these middle - income countries are a legacy of government economic controls that for political reasons can be dismantled only slowly over time .,0
15226,Unemployment rates in the nations of Europe have typically been higher than in the United States .,0
15227,"In 2006 , before the start of the Great Recession , the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.6 % , compared with 9 % in France , 10.4 % in Germany , and 7.1 % in Sweden .",0
15228,"The pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in Europe , which dates back to the 1970s , is typically attributed to the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed workers from taking jobs . Addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice .",0
15229,The economies of Europe thrive with high levels of trade .,0
15230,"In the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , the United States , Canada , and Mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade barriers .",1
15231,Many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially beneficial to the economy .,0
15232,"In order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) .",0
15233,"A trade surplus , you may remember , exists when a nation ’s exports exceed its imports .",1
15234,"So , in order for a trade deficit to switch to a trade surplus , a nation ’s exports must rise and its imports must fall .",0
15235,Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods .,1
15236,The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this : “ What do we give up to produce this good ? ” It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity .,0
15237,"For example , if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper , its labor , land and financial resources can not be used to produce other goods such as corn .",0
15238,"Given their current production levels , if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels , it will gain from trade .",0
15239,"With trade , the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade .",0
15240,( Recall that the chapter,0
15241,"If Mexico wants to produce more refrigerators without trade , it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe production .",0
15242,"If Mexico , instead , produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the United States , where the opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower , Mexico can in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the United States .",0
15243,"Conversely , when the United States specializes in its comparative advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico , international trade allows the United States to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico .",0
15244,"Traditionally , tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic , social , and cultural interests .",0
15245,The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) is committed to lowering barriers to trade .,0
15246,"The world ’s nations meet through the WTO to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade , such as tariffs .",0
15247,"They make imports more expensive for consumers , discouraging imports .",0
15248,"For example , in recent years large , flat - screen televisions imported from China have faced a 5 % tariff rate . Another way to control trade is through import quotas , which are numerical limitations on the quantity of products that can be imported .",1
15249,"For instance , during the early 1980s , the Reagan Administration imposed a quota on the import of Japanese automobiles .",0
15250,"Each country has a domestic supply and demand for sugar , as detailed in [ link ] and illustrated in [ link ] .",0
15251,"In Brazil , without trade , the equilibrium price of sugar is 12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output is 30 tons .",0
15252,This is an example of induced polarization of neutral objects .,0
15253,Polarization is the separation of charges in an object that remains neutral .,1
15254,"On a large scale , such as between the Earth and a person , the reverse is true .",0
15255,"Most objects are nearly electrically neutral , and so attractive and repulsive Coulomb forces nearly cancel .",0
15256,"Gravitational force on a large scale dominates interactions between large objects because it is always attractive , while Coulomb forces tend to cancel .",0
15257,"The magnitude of the dipole is called the dipole moment . These two centers of charge will terminate some of the electric field lines coming from a free charge , as on a DNA molecule .",1
15258,This results in a reduction in the strength of the Coulomb interaction .,0
15259,One might say that screening makes the Coulomb force a short range force rather than long range .,0

15268,"The more easily it is polarized , the greater its dielectric constant κκ size 12{k } { } .",0
15269,"Water , for example , is a polar molecule because one end of the molecule has a slight positive charge and the other end has a slight negative charge .",0

15282,A measure of this limit on charge flow is called resistance .,1
15283,When are resistors in series ?,0
15284,"Resistors are in series whenever the flow of charge , called the current , must flow through devices sequentially .",1
15285,"For example , if current flows through a person holding a screwdriver and into the Earth , then R1R1 size 12{R rSub { size 8{1 } } } { } in [ link](a ) could be the resistance of the screwdriver ’s shaft , R2R2 size 12{R rSub { size 8{2 } } } { } the resistance of its handle , R3R3 size 12{R rSub { size 8{3 } } } { } the person ’s body resistance , and R4R4 size 12{R rSub { size 8{4 } } } { } the resistance of her shoes .",0

15300,"Since isolated north and south magnetic poles , called magnetic monopoles , are not observed , currents are used to explain all magnetic effects .",1
15301,"If magnetic monopoles did exist , then we would have to modify this underlying connection that all magnetism is due to electrical current .",0
15302,The pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful in visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field .,0

15385,"Furthermore , Young first passed light from a single source ( the Sun ) through a single slit to make the light somewhat coherent .",0
15386,"By coherent , we mean waves are in phase or have a definite phase relationship .",1
15387,Incoherent means the waves have random phase relationships .,1
15388,There are specific directions for the oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields .,0
15389,Polarization is the attribute that a wave ’s oscillations have a definite direction relative to the direction of propagation of the wave .,1
15390,( This is not the same type of polarization as that discussed for the separation of charges . ),0
15391,"To examine this further , consider the transverse waves in the ropes shown in [ link ] .",0
15392,The oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane and are said to be vertically polarized .,1
15393,Those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane and are horizontally polarized .,0
15394,Einstein essentially did the theoretical aspect of this method for relativity .,0
15395,"With two deceptively simple postulates and a careful consideration of how measurements are made , he produced the theory of special relativity . Einstein ’s First Postulate",0
15396,"Not only are laws of physics simplest in inertial frames , but they should be the same in all inertial frames , since there is no preferred frame and no absolute motion .",0
15397,Einstein incorporated these ideas into his first postulate of special relativity . First Postulate of Special Relativity,0
15398,Time dilation is the phenomenon of time passing slower for an observer who is moving relative to another observer .,1
15399,"Just as with classical physics , quantum physics has several subfields , such as mechanics and the study of electromagnetic forces .",0
15400,"The correspondence principle states that in the classical limit ( large , slow - moving objects ) , quantum mechanics becomes the same as classical physics .",1
15401,"In this chapter , we begin the development of quantum mechanics and its description of the strange submicroscopic world .",0
15402,"When light strikes materials , it can eject electrons from them .",0
15403,"This is called the photoelectric effect , meaning that light ( photo ) produces electricity .",1
15404,"One common use of the photoelectric effect is in light meters , such as those that adjust the automatic iris on various types of cameras .",0
15405,"A curve like this is obtained by detecting many photons , and it is apparent that the maximum energy is unlikely .",0
15406,This decelerating process produces radiation that is called bremsstrahlung ( German for braking radiation ) .,1
15407,"The second feature is the existence of sharp peaks in the spectrum ; these are called characteristic x rays , since they are characteristic of the anode material .",1
15408,"The range of photon energies for visible light from red to violet is 1.63 to 3.26 eV , respectively ( left for this chapter ’s Problems and Exercises to verify ) .",0
15409,These energies are on the order of those between outer electron shells in atoms and molecules .,0
15410,"The quantum of EM radiation we call a photon has properties analogous to those of particles we can see , such as grains of sand .",1
15411,"A photon interacts as a unit in collisions or when absorbed , rather than as an extensive wave .",0
15412,"After compiling enough data , you get a distribution related to the particle ’s wavelength and diffraction pattern .",0
15413,"There is a certain probability of finding the particle at a given location , and the overall pattern is called a probability distribution .",1
15414,Those who developed quantum mechanics devised equations that predicted the probability distribution in various circumstances .,0
15415,Another is what Democritus in particular believed — that there is a smallest unit that can not be further subdivided .,1
15416,Democritus called this the atom .,0
15417,"We now know that atoms themselves can be subdivided , but their identity is destroyed in the process , so the Greeks were correct in a respect .",0
15418,"Based on the size and mass of the nucleus revealed by his experiment , as well as the mass of electrons , Rutherford proposed the planetary model of the atom .",0
15419,The planetary model of the atom pictures low - mass electrons orbiting a large - mass nucleus .,1
15420,Double - slit interference ( Wave Optics ) .,0
15421,"To obtain constructive interference for a double slit , the path length difference from two slits must be an integral multiple of the wavelength .",0
15422,for the orbital energies of hydrogen - like atoms .,0
15423,"Here , E0E0 size 12{E rSub { size 8{0 } } } { } is the ground - state energy n=1n=1 size 12 { left ( n=1 right ) } { } for hydrogen Z=1Z=1 size 12 { left ( Z=1 right ) } { } and is given byE0=2π2qe4mek2h2=13.6 eV.E0=2π2qe4mek2h2=13.6 eV.Thus , for hydrogen ,",0
15424,"Thus , typical x - ray photons act like rays when they encounter macroscopic objects , like teeth , and produce sharp shadows ; however , since atoms are on the order of 0.1 nm in size , x rays can be used to detect the location , shape , and size of atoms and molecules .",1
15425,"The process is called x - ray diffraction , because it involves the diffraction and interference of x rays to produce patterns that can be analyzed for information about the structures that scattered the x rays .",0
15426,"Perhaps the most famous example of x - ray diffraction is the discovery of the double - helix structure of DNA in 1953 by an international team of scientists working at the Cavendish Laboratory — American James Watson , Englishman Francis Crick , and New Zealand – born Maurice Wilkins .",0
15427,"Some of these may be in the visible range , such as for the scorpion in [ link ] .",0
15428,"Fluorescence is defined to be any process in which an atom or molecule , excited by a photon of a given energy , and de - excites by emission of a lower - energy photon . Fluorescence can be induced by many types of energy input .",1
15429,"Fluorescent paint , dyes , and even soap residues in clothes make colors seem brighter in sunlight by converting some UV into visible light .",0
15430,This includes those electrons originally excited to the metastable state and those that fell into it from above .,0
15431,"It is possible to get a majority of the atoms into the metastable state , a condition called a population inversion .",0
15432,"( a ) Energy - level diagram for an atom showing the first few states , one of which is metastable .",0
15433,( b ) Massive energy input excites atoms to a variety of states .,0
15434,"The name hologram means “ entire picture ” ( from the Greek holo , as in holistic ) , because the image is three - dimensional .",1
15435,"Holography is the process of producing holograms and , although they are recorded on photographic film , the process is quite different from normal photography .",1
15436,The new insight is that the direction of the orbital angular momentum is also quantized .,0
15437,The fact that the orbital angular momentum can have only certain directions is called space quantization .,1
15438,"Like many aspects of quantum mechanics , this quantization of direction is totally unexpected .",0
15439,"That is , no two electrons can be in the same state .",0
15440,"This statement is known as the Pauli exclusion principle , because it excludes electrons from being in the same state .",1
15441,The Pauli exclusion principle is extremely powerful and very broadly applicable .,0
15442,The rays themselves are called nuclear radiation .,0
15443,A nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to decay ( a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states ) .,1
15444,A substance or object that emits nuclear radiation is said to be radioactive . Two types of experimental evidence imply that Becquerel ’s rays originate deep in the heart ( or nucleus ) of an atom .,1
15445,The range of radiation is defined to be the distance it can travel through a material .,1
15446,"Range is related to several factors , including the energy of the radiation , the material encountered , and the type of radiation ( see [ link ] ) .",0
15447,Scintillator detectors are used in a variety of research and diagnostic applications .,0
15448,"Among these are the detection by satellite - mounted equipment of the radiation from distant galaxies , the analysis of radiation from a person indicating body burdens , and the detection of exotic particles in accelerator laboratories . Light from a scintillator is converted into electrical signals by devices such as the photomultiplier tube shown schematically in [ link ] .",0
15449,"These tubes are based on the photoelectric effect , which is multiplied in stages into a cascade of electrons , hence the name photomultiplier .",0
15450,We have already identified protons as the particles that carry positive charge in the nuclei .,1
15451,"However , there are actually two types of particles in the nuclei — the proton and the neutron , referred to collectively as nucleons , the constituents of nuclei .",1
15452,"As its name implies , the neutron is a neutral particle ( q=0q=0 size 12{q=0 } { } ) that has nearly the same mass and intrinsic spin as the proton .",1
15453,Nuclear decay has provided an amazing window into the realm of the very small .,0
15454,"Nuclear decay gave the first indication of the connection between mass and energy , and it revealed the existence of two of the four basic forces in nature .",1
15455,"The neutrino in β−β− size 12{β rSup { size 8 { - { } } } } { } decay is an electron ’s antineutrino , given the symbol ν¯eν¯e , where νν is the Greek letter nu , and the subscript e means this neutrino is related to the electron .",0
15456,The bar indicates this is a particle of antimatter .,0
15457,( All particles have antimatter counterparts that are nearly identical except that they have the opposite charge .,0
15458,Electron capture is the third type of beta decay .,1
15459,"Here , a nucleus captures an inner - shell electron and undergoes a nuclear reaction that has the same effect as β+β+ size 12{β rSup { size 8{+ { } } } } { } decay .",0
15460,"For an arbitrary time , not just a multiple of the half - life , the exponential relationship must be used . Radioactive dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity .",0
15461,Its most famous application is carbon-14 dating .,0
15462,"Carbon-14 has a half - life of 5730 years and is produced in a nuclear reaction induced when solar neutrinos strike 14N14N size 12 { """" """" lSup { size 8{""""14 """" } } N } { } in the atmosphere .",1
15463,"The probability of finding a particle is related to the square of its wave function , and so there is a small probability of finding the particle outside the barrier , which implies that the particle can tunnel through the barrier .",1
15464,This process is called barrier penetration or quantum mechanical tunneling .,0
15465,This concept was developed in theory by J. Robert Oppenheimer ( who led the development of the first nuclear bombs during World War II ) and was used by Gamow and others to describe αα size 12{α } { } decay .,0
15466,The compound is said to be tagged .,0
15467,A tagged compound used for medical purposes is called a radiopharmaceutical .,1
15468,Radiation detectors external to the body can determine the location and concentration of a radiopharmaceutical to yield medically useful information .,0
15469,"These γγ rays have identical 0.511-MeV energies ( the energy comes from the destruction of an electron or positron mass ) and they move directly away from one another , allowing detectors to determine their point of origin accurately , as shown in [ link ] .",1
15470,The system is called positron emission tomography ( PET ) .,0
15471,"It requires detectors on opposite sides to simultaneously ( i.e. , at the same time ) detect photons of 0.511-MeV energy and utilizes computer imaging techniques similar to those in SPECT and CT scans .",0
15472,"Under this assumption , any dose of radiation , no matter how small , involves a risk to human health .",1
15473,"This is called the linear hypothesis and it may be prudent , but it is controversial .",0
15474,"There is some evidence that , unlike the immediate effects of radiation , the long - term effects are cumulative and there is little self - repair .",0
15475,"Therapeutic applications of ionizing radiation , called radiation therapy or radiotherapy , have existed since the discovery of x - rays and nuclear radioactivity .",1
15476,"Today , radiotherapy is used almost exclusively for cancer therapy , where it saves thousands of lives and improves the quality of life and longevity of many it can not save .",0
15477,How does food irradiation work ?,0
15478,"Ionization produces a random assortment of broken molecules and ions , some with unstable oxygen- or hydrogen - containing molecules known as free radicals .",1
15479,"These undergo rapid chemical reactions , producing perhaps four or five thousand different compounds called radiolytic products , some of which make cell function impossible by breaking cell membranes , fracturing DNA , and so on .",0
15480,"These three factors — temperature , density , and time — complement one another , and so a deficiency in one can be compensated for by the others .",0
15481,Ignition is defined to occur when the reactions produce enough energy to be self - sustaining after external energy input is cut off .,1
15482,"This goal , which must be reached before commercial plants can be a reality , has not been achieved .",0
15483,"Huge power input heats the fuel , evaporating the confining pellet and crushing the fuel to high density with the expanding hot plasma produced .",1
15484,"This technique is called inertial confinement , because the fuel ’s inertia prevents it from escaping before significant fusion can take place .",0
15485,"Higher densities have been reached than with tokamaks , but with smaller confinement times .",0
15486,"Coulomb repulsion between the two ends then succeeds in fissioning the nucleus , which pops like a water drop into two large pieces and a few neutrons .",0
15487,Neutron - induced fission can be written as,0
15488,"To produce large power , reactors contain hundreds to thousands of critical masses , and the chain reaction easily becomes self - sustaining , a condition called criticality .",1
15489,"Neutron flux should be carefully regulated to avoid an exponential increase in fissions , a condition called supercriticality .",1
15490,"Individuals who experience depersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own ; they may feel robotic as though they lack control over their movements and speech ; they may experience a distorted sense of time and , in extreme cases , they may sense an “ out - of - body ” experience in which they see themselves from the vantage point of another person .",1
15491,"Derealization is conceptualized as a sense of “ unreality or detachment from , or unfamiliarity with , the world , be it individuals , inanimate objects , or all surroundings ” ( APA , 2013 , p. 303 ) .",1
15492,"A person who experiences derealization might feel as though he is in a fog or a dream , or that the surrounding world is somehow artificial and unreal .",0
15493,"These kinds of delusions are known as paranoid delusions , which involve the ( false ) belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm the person .",1
15494,"People with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions , beliefs that one holds special power , unique knowledge , or is extremely important .",1
15495,"For example , the person who claims to be Jesus Christ , or who claims to have knowledge going back 5,000 years , or who claims to be a great philosopher is experiencing grandiose delusions .",0
15496,"Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements : becoming unusually active , exhibiting silly child - like behaviors ( giggling and self - absorbed smiling ) , engaging in repeated and purposeless movements , or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures .",1
15497,"In some cases , the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors , which show decreased reactivity to the environment , such as posturing , in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time , or catatonic stupor , a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior .",1
15498,"Interest in the role of dopamine in schizophrenia was stimulated by two sets of findings : drugs that increase dopamine levels can produce schizophrenia - like symptoms , and medications that block dopamine activity reduce the symptoms ( Howes & Kapur , 2009 ) .",0
15499,"The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that an overabundance of dopamine or too many dopamine receptors are responsible for the onset and maintenance of schizophrenia ( Snyder , 1976 ) .",1
15500,More recent work in this area suggests that abnormalities in dopamine vary by brain region and thus contribute to symptoms in unique ways .,0
15501,Early detection and treatment of conditions such as heart disease and cancer have improved survival rates and quality of life for people who suffer from these conditions .,0
15502,"A new approach involves identifying people who show minor symptoms of psychosis , such as unusual thought content , paranoia , odd communication , delusions , problems at school or work , and a decline in social functioning — which are coined prodromal symptoms — and following these individuals over time to determine which of them develop a psychotic disorder and which factors best predict such a disorder .",0
15503,"A number of factors have been identified that predict a greater likelihood that prodromal individuals will develop a psychotic disorder : genetic risk ( a family history of psychosis ) , recent deterioration in functioning , high levels of unusual thought content , high levels of suspicion or paranoia , poor social functioning , and a history of substance abuse ( Fusar - Poli et al . , 2013 ) .",0
15504,"The term personality refers loosely to one ’s stable , consistent , and distinctive way of thinking about , feeling , acting , and relating to the world .",1
15505,"People with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that differs markedly from the expectations of their culture , is pervasive and inflexible , begins in adolescence or early adulthood , and causes distress or impairment ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
15506,"Generally , individuals with these disorders exhibit enduring personality styles that are extremely troubling and often create problems for them and those with whom they come into contact .",0
15507,"People with these disorders usually are impulsive , overly dramatic , highly emotional , and erratic .",0
15508,"Cluster C disorders include avoidant personality disorder , dependent personality disorder , and obsessive - compulsive personality disorder ( which is not the same thing as obsessive - compulsive disorder ) .",1
15509,People with these disorders often appear to be nervous and fearful .,0
15510,"Mood disorders ( [ link ] ) are characterized by severe disturbances in mood and emotions — most often depression , but also mania and elation ( Rothschild , 1999 ) .",1
15511,"All of us experience fluctuations in our moods and emotional states , and often these fluctuations are caused by events in our lives .",0
15512,"These subtypes — what the DSM-5 refer to as specifiers — are not specific disorders ; rather , they are labels used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms or to specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present .",0
15513,"One subtype , seasonal pattern , applies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder only during a particular time of year ( e.g. , fall or winter ) .",1
15514,"In everyday language , people often refer to this subtype as the winter blues .",0
15515,"A person with bipolar disorder ( commonly known as manic depression ) often experiences mood states that vacillate between depression and mania ; that is , the person ’s mood is said to alternate from one emotional extreme to the other ( in contrast to unipolar , which indicates a persistently sad mood ) .",1
15516,"If so , what might such predispositions be ?",0
15517,A study by Caspi and others ( 2003 ) suggests that an alteration in a specific gene that regulates serotonin ( the 5-HTTLPR gene ) might be one culprit .,0
15518,These investigators found that people who experienced several stressful life events were significantly more likely to experience episodes of major depression if they carried one or two short versions of this gene than if they carried two long versions .,0
15519,"This theory , which focuses on rumination in the development of depression , was first described in the late 1980s to explain the higher rates of depression in women than in men ( Nolen - Hoeksema , 1987 ) .",0
15520,"Rumination is the repetitive and passive focus on the fact that one is depressed and dwelling on depressed symptoms , rather that distracting one ’s self from the symptoms or attempting to address them in an active , problem - solving manner ( Nolen - Hoeksema , 1991 ) .",1
15521,"When people ruminate , they have thoughts such as “ Why am I so unmotivated ?",0
15522,"Obsessive - compulsive and related disorders are a group of overlapping disorders that generally involve intrusive , unpleasant thoughts and repetitive behaviors .",0
15523,"Many of us experience unwanted thoughts from time to time ( e.g. , craving double cheeseburgers when dieting ) , and many of us engage in repetitive behaviors on occasion ( e.g. , pacing when nervous ) .",0
15524,"Compulsions are repetitive and ritualistic acts that are typically carried out primarily as a means to minimize the distress that obsessions trigger or to reduce the likelihood of a feared event ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
15525,"Compulsions often include such behaviors as repeated and extensive hand washing , cleaning , checking ( e.g. , that a door is locked ) , and ordering ( e.g. , lining up all the pencils in a particular way ) , and they also include such mental acts as counting , praying , or reciting something to oneself ( [ link ] ) .",0
15526,"Compulsions characteristic of OCD are not performed out of pleasure , nor are they connected in a realistic way to the source of the distress or feared event .",0
15527,"A brain region that is believed to play a critical role in OCD is the orbitofrontal cortex ( Kopell & Greenberg , 2008 ) , an area of the frontal lobe involved in learning and decision - making ( Rushworth , Noonan , Boorman , Walton , & Behrens , 2011 ) ( [ link ] ) .",1
15528,"In people with OCD , the orbitofrontal cortex becomes especially hyperactive when they are provoked with tasks in which , for example , they are asked to look at a photo of a toilet or of pictures hanging crookedly on a wall ( Simon , Kaufmann , Müsch , Kischkel , & Kathmann , 2010 ) .",0
15529,SPECIFIC PHOBIAPhobia is a Greek word that means fear .,0
15530,"A person diagnosed with a specific phobia ( formerly known as simple phobia ) experiences excessive , distressing , and persistent fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation ( such as animals , enclosed spaces , elevators , or flying ) ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
15531,"Even though people realize their level of fear and anxiety in relation to the phobic stimulus is irrational , some people with a specific phobia may go to great lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus ( the object or situation that triggers the fear and anxiety ) .",0
15532,"The second pathway of phobia acquisition is through vicarious learning , such as modeling .",0
15533,"For example , a child who observes his cousin react fearfully to spiders may later express the same fears , even though spiders have never presented any danger to him .",0
15534,"People with panic disorder experience recurrent ( more than one ) and unexpected panic attacks , along with at least one month of persistent concern about additional panic attacks , worry over the consequences of the attacks , or self - defeating changes in behavior related to the attacks ( e.g. , avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations ) ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
15535,"As is the case with other anxiety disorders , the panic attacks can not result from the physiological effects of drugs and other substances , a medical condition , or another mental disorder .",0
15536,"Conditioning theories of panic disorder propose that panic attacks are classical conditioning responses to subtle bodily sensations resembling those normally occurring when one is anxious or frightened ( Bouton , Mineka , & Barlow , 2001 ) .",1
15537,"For example , consider a child who has asthma .",0
15538,"For centuries , psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective : attributed to a force beyond scientific understanding .",1
15539,"Those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or possessed by spirits ( [ link ] ) ( Maher & Maher , 1985 ) .",0
15540,"The diathesis - stress model ( Zuckerman , 1999 ) integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict the likelihood of a disorder .",0
15541,"This diathesis - stress model suggests that people with an underlying predisposition for a disorder ( i.e. , a diathesis ) are more likely than others to develop a disorder when faced with adverse environmental or psychological events ( i.e. , stress ) , such as childhood maltreatment , negative life events , trauma , and so on .",1
15542,Such feelings would be normal .,0
15543,"If you felt extremely depressed — so much so that you lost interest in activities , had difficulty eating or sleeping , felt utterly worthless , and contemplated suicide — your feelings would be atypical , would deviate from the norm , and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder .",0
15544,"Just because something is atypical , however , does not necessarily mean it is disordered .",0
15545,Many of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychological disorder developed by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .,0
15546,"According to the APA ( 2013 ) , a psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following :",0
15547,The DSM-5 also provides information about comorbidity ; the co - occurrence of two disorders .,1
15548,"For example , the DSM-5 mentions that 41 % of people with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) also meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder ( [ link ] ) .",0
15549,"Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists ( [ link ] ) who focused on temperament , the inborn , genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter .",0
15550,They believed personality is largely governed by biology .,0
15551,"The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .",0
15552,"The term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and traditions of a particular society .",1
15553,"Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally acceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .",0
15554,Another method for assessment of personality is projective testing .,0
15555,This kind of test relies on one of the defense mechanisms proposed by Freud — projection — as a way to assess unconscious processes .,1
15556,"A third projective test is the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank ( RISB ) developed by Julian Rotter in 1950 ( recall his theory of locus of control , covered earlier in this chapter ) .",0
15557,"Schizophrenia is a devastating psychological disorder that is characterized by major disturbances in thought , perception , emotion , and behavior .",1
15558,"About 1 % of the population experiences schizophrenia in their lifetime , and usually the disorder is first diagnosed during early adulthood ( early to mid-20s ) .",0
15559,Disorganized thinking refers to disjointed and incoherent thought processes — usually detected by what a person says .,1
15560,"The person might ramble , exhibit loose associations ( jump from topic to topic ) , or talk in a way that is so disorganized and incomprehensible that it seems as though the person is randomly combining words .",0
15561,"Negative symptoms are those that reflect noticeable decreases and absences in certain behaviors , emotions , or drives ( Green , 2001 ) .",1
15562,"A person who exhibits diminished emotional expression shows no emotion in his facial expressions , speech , or movements , even when such expressions are normal or expected .",1
15563,Another variable that is linked to schizophrenia is marijuana use .,0
15564,"Although a number of reports have shown that individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to use marijuana than are individuals without schizophrenia ( Thornicroft , 1990 ) , such investigations can not determine if marijuana use leads to schizophrenia , or vice versa .",0
15565,"These experiences can include such events as combat , threatened or actual physical attack , sexual assault , natural disasters , terrorist attacks , and automobile accidents .",0
15566,"This criterion makes PTSD the only disorder listed in the DSM in which a cause ( extreme trauma ) is explicitly specified . Symptoms of PTSD include intrusive and distressing memories of the event , flashbacks ( states that can last from a few seconds to several days , during which the individual relives the event and behaves as if the event were occurring at that moment [ APA , 2013 ] ) , avoidance of stimuli connected to the event , persistently negative emotional states ( e.g. , fear , anger , guilt , and shame ) , feelings of detachment from others , irritability , proneness toward outbursts , and an exaggerated startle response ( jumpiness ) .",1
15567,"For PTSD to be diagnosed , these symptoms must occur for at least one month .",0
15568,Bipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature .,1
15569,Mania is a state of extreme elation and agitation .,1
15570,"suicidal ideation : thoughts of death ( not just fear of dying ) , thinking about or planning suicide , or making an actual suicide attempt .",1
15571,"People with persistent depressive disorder ( previously known as dysthymia ) experience depressed moods most of the day nearly every day for at least two years , as well as at least two of the other symptoms of major depressive disorder .",1
15572,"People with persistent depressive disorder are chronically sad and melancholy , but do not meet all the criteria for major depression .",0
15573,"During a manic episode , some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative , sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers ; others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments .",1
15574,"The person may talk loudly and rapidly , exhibiting flight of ideas , abruptly switching from one topic to another .",0
15575,"These individuals are easily distracted , which can make a conversation very difficult .",0
15576,"Another cognitive theory of depression , hopelessness theory , postulates that a particular style of negative thinking leads to a sense of hopelessness , which then leads to depression ( Abramson , Metalsky , & Alloy , 1989 ) .",1
15577,"According to this theory , hopelessness is an expectation that unpleasant outcomes will occur or that desired outcomes will not occur , and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes .",1
15578,One possible contributing factor in suicide is brain chemistry .,0
15579,"Contemporary neurological research shows that disturbances in the functioning of serotonin are linked to suicidal behavior ( Pompili et al . , 2010 ) .",0

15581,"Although hoarding was traditionally considered to be a symptom of OCD , considerable evidence suggests that hoarding represents an entirely different disorder ( Mataix - Cols et al . , 2010 ) .",0
15582,"People with hoarding disorder can not bear to part with personal possessions , regardless of how valueless or useless these possessions are .",1

15584,This woman likely would experience anxiety of greater intensity and duration than would a 21-year - old college junior who is having trouble finding a date for the annual social .,0
15585,"Some people , however , experience anxiety that is excessive , persistent , and greatly out of proportion to the actual threat ; if one ’s anxiety has a disruptive influence on one ’s life , this is a strong indicator that the individual is experiencing an anxiety disorder . Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive and persistent fear and anxiety , and by related disturbances in behavior ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
15586,"Although anxiety is universally experienced , anxiety disorders cause considerable distress .",0
15587,Rachman ( 1977 ) proposed that phobias can be acquired through three major learning pathways .,0
15588,The first pathway is through classical conditioning .,0
15589,"As you may recall , classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response ( UCR ) , eliciting the same response through its association with the unconditioned stimulus .",1
15590,"When people with social anxiety disorder are unable to avoid situations that provoke anxiety , they typically perform safety behaviors : mental or behavioral acts that reduce anxiety in social situations by reducing the chance of negative social outcomes .",1
15591,"Safety behaviors include avoiding eye contact , rehearsing sentences before speaking , talking only briefly , and not talking about oneself ( Alden & Bieling , 1998 ) .",0
15592,"The exact genes and gene functions involved in this disorder , however , are not well - understood ( APA , 2013 ) .",0
15593,Neurobiological theories of panic disorder suggest that a region of the brain called the locus coeruleus may play a role in this disorder .,1
15594,"Located in the brainstem , the locus coeruleus is the brain ’s major source of norepinephrine , a neurotransmitter that triggers the body ’s fight - or - flight response .",1
15595,"For example , an individual may worry about her health and finances , the health of family members , the safety of her children , or minor matters ( e.g. , being late for an appointment ) without having any legitimate reason for doing so ( APA , 2013 ) .",0
15596,"A diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder requires that the diffuse worrying and apprehension characteristic of this disorder — what Sigmund Freud referred to as free - floating anxiety — is not part of another disorder , occurs more days than not for at least six months , and is accompanied by any three of the following symptoms : restlessness , difficulty concentrating , being easily fatigued , muscle tension , irritability , and sleep difficulties .",1
15597,"Evidence from many sources indicates that most psychological disorders have a genetic component ; in fact , there is little dispute that some disorders are largely due to genetic factors .",0

15599,"A psychological disorder is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts , feelings , and behaviors .",1
15600,"Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders , including their symptoms , etiology ( i.e. , their causes ) , and treatment .",1
15601,The term psychopathology can also refer to the manifestation of a psychological disorder .,0
15602,"No universal definition of psychological disorder exists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present ( Zachar & Kendler , 2007 ) .",0
15603,"However , one of the more influential conceptualizations was proposed by Wakefield ( 1992 ) , who defined psychological disorder as a harmful dysfunction .",0
15604,"Wakefield argued that natural internal mechanisms — that is , psychological processes honed by evolution , such as cognition , perception , and learning — have important functions , such as enabling us to experience the world the way others do and to engage in rational thought , problem solving , and communication .",1
15605,"THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS ( DSM)Although a number of classification systems have been developed over time , the one that is used by most mental health professionals in the United States is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) , published by the American Psychiatric Association ( 2013 ) .",0

15607,"Trait theorists believe personality can be understood via the approach that all people have certain traits , or characteristic ways of behaving .",1
15608,Do you tend to be sociable or shy ?,0
15609,"As you have learned in this chapter , personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors .",0
15610,"The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality ( Triandis & Suh , 2002 ) .",0
15611,"The term culture refers to all of the beliefs , customs , art , and traditions of a particular society .",1
15612,"One of the most widely used personality inventories is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ( MMPI ) , first published in 1943 , with 504 true / false questions , and updated to the MMPI-2 in 1989 , with 567 questions .",0
15613,"The original MMPI was based on a small , limited sample , composed mostly of Minnesota farmers and psychiatric patients ; the revised inventory was based on a more representative , national sample to allow for better standardization .",0
15614,"A second projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test ( TAT ) , created in the 1930s by Henry Murray , an American psychologist , and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan .",0
15615,A person taking the TAT is shown 8–12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture .,1
15616,The C - TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African - American lifestyles .,0
15617,"When the C - TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans , it was found that use of the C - TCB led to increased story length , higher degrees of positive feelings , and stronger identification with the C - TCB ( Hoy , 1997 ; Hoy - Watkins & Jenkins - Moore , 2008).The TEMAS Multicultural Thematic Apperception Test is another tool designed to be culturally relevant to minority groups , especially Hispanic youths .",1
15618,This is precisely the situation that Charles Darwin describes in the theory of evolution by natural selection ( [ link ] ) .,0
15619,"In simple terms , the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce , while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off .",1
15620,"During the egg 's journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes , to the uterus , a sperm may fertilize an egg . The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes .",0
15621,Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) .,1
15622,DNA is a helix - shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs .,1
15623,"Therefore , each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring ; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring ( called the phenotype ) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents ( called the genotype ) .",1
15624,A person ’s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual .,1
15625,"Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( [ link ] ) .",1
15626,( a ) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material ( DNA ) inherited from one ’s parents .,1
15627,"So far , we have discussed traits that involve just one gene , but few human characteristics are controlled by a single gene .",0
15628,Most traits are polygenic : controlled by more than one gene .,1
15629,"Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . In this Punnett square , N represents the normal allele , and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PKU .",0
15630,Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment ; range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction .,0
15631,"Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate , and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall .",1
15632,"For example , if an individual ’s genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich , stimulating environment , then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation .",0
15633,"As mentioned earlier , gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious .",0
15634,"For instance , identical twins share the same genetic information ( identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split , so the genetic material is exactly the same in each ; in contrast , fraternal twins develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm , so the genetic material varies as with non - twin siblings ) .",1
15635,"But even with identical genes , there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin ’s life .",0
15636,"In a study of people who were given up for adoption , adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study :",0
15637,"Glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built , help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication , provide insulation to neurons , transport nutrients and waste products , and mediate immune responses .",1
15638,"Neurons , on the other hand , serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system .",1
15639,This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons .,0
15640,"The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma , or cell body .",1
15641,The soma has branching extensions known as dendrites .,0
15642,"These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon , which ends at multiple terminal buttons .",0
15643,"The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical messengers of the nervous system .",1
15644,"Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron .",0
15645,"Receptors , proteins on the cell surface where neurotransmitters attach , vary in shape , with different shapes “ matching ” different neurotransmitters .",1
15646,"Between signals , the neuron membrane ’s potential is held in a state of readiness , called the resting potential .",1
15647,"Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i.e. , a sodium - potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) .",0
15648,This positive spike constitutes the action potential : the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals .,1
15649,"The electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave ; at each point , some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon , raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions .",0
15650,"The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron , and the process repeats itself in the new neuron ( assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential ) .",0
15651,"Once the signal is delivered , excess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away , are broken down into inactive fragments , or are reabsorbed in a process known as reuptake .",0
15652,"Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron that released it , in order to clear the synapse ( [ link ] ) .",1
15653,"In this perspective , psychotropic medications can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders .",0
15654,Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance .,1
15655,Acetylcholine is involved in muscle action and memory ; it can increase arousal and enhance cognition .,0
15656,"The nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions : the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , shown in [ link ] .",0
15657,The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord ; the PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body .,1
15658,It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions ( [ link ] ) .,0
15659,"The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress - related activities ; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine , day - to - day operations .",1
15660,"The two systems have complementary functions , operating in tandem to maintain the body ’s homeostasis .",0
15661,"For example , think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give a presentation in front of a roomful of people , or right before taking a big test .",0
15662,"You are in no real physical danger in those situations , and yet you have evolved to respond to any perceived threat with the fight or flight response .",0
15663,"This kind of response is not nearly as adaptive in the modern world ; in fact , we suffer negative health consequences when faced constantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee .",0
15664,These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers .,0
15665,"The most prominent sulcus , known as the longitudinal fissure , is the deep groove that separates the brain into two halves or hemispheres : the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere .",1
15666,"Forebrain StructuresThe two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex are part of the forebrain ( [ link ] ) , which is the largest part of the brain .",0
15667,"The forebrain contains the cerebral cortex and a number of other structures that lie beneath the cortex ( called subcortical structures ) : thalamus , hypothalamus , pituitary gland , and the limbic system ( collection of structures ) .",1
15668,Probably the most famous case of frontal lobe damage is that of a man by the name of Phineas Gage .,0
15669,"On September 13 , 1848 , Gage ( age 25 ) was working as a railroad foreman in Vermont .",0
15670,"The brain ’s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’s senses .",1
15671,"It contains the somatosensory cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as touch , temperature , and pain .",1
15672,"The somatosensory cortex is organized topographically , which means that spatial relationships that exist in the body are maintained on the surface of the somatosensory cortex ( [ link ] ) .",0
15673,"The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .",1
15674,"Wernicke ’s area , important for speech comprehension , is also located here .",1
15675,"Whereas individuals with damage to Broca ’s area have difficulty producing language , those with damage to Wernicke ’s area can produce sensible language , but they are unable to understand it ( [ link ] ) .",0
15676,"Other Areas of the ForebrainOther areas of the forebrain , located beneath the cerebral cortex , include the thalamus and the limbic system .",0
15677,The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain .,1
15678,"All of our senses , with the exception of smell , are routed through the thalamus before being directed to other areas of the brain for processing ( [ link ] ) .",0
15679,The hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory .,1
15680,The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .,1
15681,"The hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes , including the regulation of body temperature , appetite , and blood pressure .",1
15682,"Midbrain and Hindbrain StructuresThe midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain , between the forebrain and the hindbrain .",1
15683,"The reticular formation is centered in the midbrain , but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain .",1
15684,The hindbrain is located at the back of the head and looks like an extension of the spinal cord .,1
15685,"It contains the medulla , pons , and cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .",0
15686,"The cerebellum ( Latin for “ little brain ” ) receives messages from muscles , tendons , joints , and structures in our ear to control balance , coordination , movement , and motor skills .",1
15687,The cerebellum is also thought to be an important area for processing some types of memories .,0
15688,A computerized tomography ( CT ) scan involves taking a number of x - rays of a particular section of a person ’s body or brain ( [ link ] ) .,1
15689,"The x - rays pass through tissues of different densities at different rates , allowing a computer to construct an overall image of the area of the body being scanned .",0
15690,"Tissues of different densities give off different signals , which a computer interprets and displays on a monitor .",0
15691,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) operates on the same principles , but it shows changes in brain activity over time by tracking blood flow and oxygen levels .",1
15692,"The fMRI provides more detailed images of the brain ’s structure , as well as better accuracy in time , than is possible in PET scans ( [ link ] ) .",0
15693,"Major GlandsThe pituitary gland descends from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain , and acts in close association with it .",1
15694,"The pituitary is often referred to as the “ master gland ” because its messenger hormones control all the other glands in the endocrine system , although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus .",0
15695,"The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) .",1
15696,The pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and glucagon .,1
15697,These pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( glucagon ) .,0
15698,"For one , each participant must sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment .",0
15699,"An informed consent form provides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment , including potential risks and implications of the research .",1

15703,"Correlation means that there is a relationship between two or more variables ( such as ice cream consumption and crime ) , but this relationship does not necessarily imply cause and effect .",1
15704,"When two variables are correlated , it simply means that as one variable changes , so does the other .",1
15705,"Put another way , it means that as one variable increases so does the other , and conversely , when one variable decreases so does the other .",0
15706,A negative correlation means that the variables move in opposite directions .,1
15707,"If two variables are negatively correlated , a decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other and vice versa .",0
15708,Think back to our discussion of the research done by the American Cancer Society and how their research projects were some of the first demonstrations of the link between smoking and cancer .,0
15709,"It seems reasonable to assume that smoking causes cancer , but if we were limited to correlational research , we would be overstepping our bounds by making this assumption .",0
15710,"As you ’ve learned , the only way to establish that there is a cause - and - effect relationship between two variables is to conduct a scientific experiment .",0
15711,Experiment has a different meaning in the scientific context than in everyday life .,0
15712,"We also need to precisely define , or operationalize , what is considered violent and nonviolent .",0
15713,"An operational definition is a description of how we will measure our variables , and it is important in allowing others understand exactly how and what a researcher measures in a particular experiment .",1
15714,"In operationalizing violent behavior , we might choose to count only physical acts like kicking or punching as instances of this behavior , or we also may choose to include angry verbal exchanges .",0
15715,"In a double - blind study , both the researchers and the participants are blind to group assignments .",1
15716,Why would a researcher want to run a study where no one knows who is in which group ?,0
15717,"In our example of how violent television programs affect children ’s display of violent behavior , the independent variable is the type of program — violent or nonviolent — viewed by participants in the study ( [ link ] ) .",0
15718,A dependent variable is what the researcher measures to see how much effect the independent variable had .,1
15719,"In our example , the dependent variable is the number of violent acts displayed by the experimental participants .",0
15720,"Now that we have a sample , the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into experimental and control groups through random assignment .",0
15721,"With random assignment , all participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group .",1
15722,There is statistical software that will randomly assign each of the fourth graders in the sample to either the experimental or the control group .,0
15723,The American Psychological Association ( APA ) publishes a manual detailing how to write a paper for submission to scientific journals .,0
15724,"Unlike an article that might be published in a magazine like Psychology Today , which targets a general audience with an interest in psychology , scientific journals generally publish peer - reviewed journal articles aimed at an audience of professionals and scholars who are actively involved in research themselves .",1
15725,This is where validity comes into play .,0
15726,Validity refers to the extent to which a given instrument or tool accurately measures what it ’s supposed to measure .,1
15727,"While any valid measure is by necessity reliable , the reverse is not necessarily true .",0
15728,We want our researcher to be inconspicuous — perhaps standing at one of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information .,0
15729,This type of observational study is called naturalistic observation : observing behavior in its natural setting .,1
15730,"To better understand peer exclusion , Suzanne Fanger collaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas to observe the behavior of preschool children on a playground .",0
15731,Another potential problem in observational research is observer bias .,0
15732,"Generally , people who act as observers are closely involved in the research project and may unconsciously skew their observations to fit their research goals or expectations .",1
15733,Surveys allow researchers to gather data from larger samples than may be afforded by other research methods .,0
15734,"A sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population , which is the overall group of individuals that the researchers are interested in .",1
15735,Researchers study the sample and seek to generalize their findings to the population .,0
15736,Another approach is cross - sectional research .,0
15737,"In cross - sectional research , a researcher compares multiple segments of the population at the same time .",1

15746,"A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable , or capable of being shown to be incorrect .",0
15747,Recall from the introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( [ link ] ) .,0
15748,"The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) .",0
15749,"The root ology denotes scientific study of , and psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind .",1
15750,"Since science studies only observable phenomena and the mind is not directly observable , we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior . The scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to acquire knowledge .",0
15751,"Rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences . The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation .",0
15752,A dissertation is essentially a long research paper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate ’s doctoral training .,1
15753,"In the United States , a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert reviewers before the degree is conferred ( [ link ] ) .",0
15754,Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in the preceding section .,0

15760,"For instance , research by Jean Piaget ( [ link ] ) demonstrated that very young children do not demonstrate object permanence .",0
15761,"Object permanence refers to the understanding that physical things continue to exist , even if they are hidden from us .",1
15762,"Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals .",1
15763,"These five dimensions are known as the “ Big Five ” or the Five Factor model , and include dimensions of conscientiousness , agreeableness , neuroticism , openness , and extraversion ( [ link ] ) .",0

15767,"Researchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance , including motivation and performance anxiety , and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing .",1
15768,Research is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general .,0
15769,"As mentioned earlier , both Freud and Rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping how clinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy .",0
15770,"While aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are still found among some of today ’s therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective , Roger ’s ideas about client - centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate .",0
15771,"Furthermore , both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms of behavioral therapy , cognitive therapy , and cognitive - behavioral therapy ( [ link ] ) .",0
15772,"Wundt viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience , and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious experience .",0
15773,"Wundt used introspection ( he called it “ internal perception ” ) , a process by which someone examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible , making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed .",1
15774,"Wundt ’s version of introspection used only very specific experimental conditions in which an external stimulus was designed to produce a scientifically observable ( repeatable ) experience of the mind ( Danziger , 1980 ) .",0
15775,"Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual , because it has been naturally selected .",1
15776,"As James saw it , psychology ’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world , and as such , his perspective was known as functionalism .",0
15777,Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment .,1
15778,These men are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles .,0
15779,"The word Gestalt roughly translates to “ whole ; ” a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts , how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception .",1
15780,"For example , a song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments , but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody , rhythm , and harmony .",0
15781,"Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible , Watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control .",1
15782,"Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior , and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism .",0
15783,A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism .,0
15784,"Thus , humanism emerged .",0
15785,Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans .,1
15786,"Two of the most well - known proponents of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers ( O’Hara , n.d . ) .",0
15787,"Culture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology , yet the effects of culture on psychology are under - studied .",0
15788,"There is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from white , American settings could be assumed to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is unlikely to be true ( Betancourt & López , 1993 ) .",0
15789,Sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness .,1
15790,"Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness , thought , and behavior .",1
15791,"In between these extremes are states of consciousness related to daydreaming , intoxication as a result of alcohol or other drug use , meditative states , hypnotic states , and altered states of consciousness following sleep deprivation .",0
15792,"If we have biological rhythms , then is there some sort of biological clock ?",0
15793,"In the brain , the hypothalamus , which lies above the pituitary gland , is a main center of homeostasis .",1
15794,"For example , most people sleep during the night and are awake during the day .",0
15795,One important regulator of sleep - wake cycles is the hormone melatonin .,0
15796,"The pineal gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin , is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep ( Hardeland , Pandi - Perumal , & Cardinali , 2006 ) .",1
15797,"When we do this , we often experience jet lag .",0
15798,Jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment .,1
15799,"These symptoms include fatigue , sluggishness , irritability , and insomnia ( i.e. , a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month ’s time ) ( Roth , 2007 ) .",1
15800,"When people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day - to - day life , they accumulate a sleep debt .",0
15801,A person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis .,0
15802,The consequences of sleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency .,0
15803,One popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology .,0
15804,Evolutionary psychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have evolved over time as a result of natural selection .,1
15805,Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring .,0
15806,The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep .,0
15807,"Stage 1 sleep is a transitional phase that occurs between wakefulness and sleep , the period during which we drift off to sleep .",1
15808,"During this time , there is a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat .",0
15809,"As we move into stage 2 sleep , the body goes into a state of deep relaxation .",1
15810,"Theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain , but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles ( [ link ] ) .",0
15811,"Stage 3 and stage 4 of sleep are often referred to as deep sleep or slow - wave sleep because these stages are characterized by low frequency ( up to 4 Hz ) , high amplitude delta waves ( [ link ] ) .",1
15812,"During this time , an individual ’s heart rate and respiration slow dramatically .",0
15813,"Manifest content is the actual content , or storyline , of a dream .",1
15814,"Latent content , on the other hand , refers to the hidden meaning of a dream .",1
15815,"For instance , if a woman dreams about being chased by a snake , Freud might have argued that this represents the woman ’s fear of sexual intimacy , with the snake serving as a symbol of a man ’s penis .",0
15816,"Some forms of psychotherapy , such as cognitive - behavioral therapy , can help sufferers of insomnia .",0
15817,Cognitive - behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on cognitive processes and problem behaviors .,1
15818,"The treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes in problematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia ( e.g. , spending more waking time in bed ) .",0
15819,REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) occurs when the muscle paralysis associated with the REM sleep phase does not occur .,1
15820,"Individuals who suffer from RBD have high levels of physical activity during REM sleep , especially during disturbing dreams .",0
15821,Sleep apnea is defined by episodes during which a sleeper ’s breathing stops .,1
15822,These episodes can last 10–20 seconds or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal .,0
15823,"In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005).One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .",1
15824,"A continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper ’s nose and mouth , which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person ’s airways , forcing them to remain open , as shown in [ link ] .",1
15825,Some newer CPAP masks are smaller and cover only the nose .,0
15826,"Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section , a person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times .",1
15827,"These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness , and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles .",1
15828,"This is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during REM sleep ( Burgess & Scammell , 2012 ; Hishikawa & Shimizu , 1995 ; Luppi et al . , 2011 ) .",0
15829,"In individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder , there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence . Physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions — the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use .",1
15830,"In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .",1
15831,"Tolerance is linked to physiological dependence , and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses .",1
15832,"Ethanol , which we commonly refer to as alcohol , is in a class of psychoactive drugs known as depressants ( [ link ] ) .",0
15833,A depressant is a drug that tends to suppress central nervous system activity .,1
15834,Other depressants include barbiturates and benzodiazepines .,0
15835,"The cocaine , amphetamine , cathinones , and MDMA users seek a euphoric high , feelings of intense elation and pleasure , especially in those users who take the drug via intravenous injection or smoking .",0
15836,Repeated use of these stimulants can have significant adverse consequences .,0
15837,"An opioid is one of a category of drugs that includes heroin , morphine , methadone , and codeine .",1
15838,"Opioids have analgesic properties ; that is , they decrease pain .",0
15839,Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs .,1
15840,Methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone .,1
15841,"Other drugs , including the opioid buprenorphine , have also been used to alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal .",0
15842,Hypnosis is a state of extreme self - focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external stimuli .,1
15843,"In the therapeutic setting , a clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughts and perceptions of a patient .",0
15844,"These cells relay messages , in the form of action potentials ( as you learned when studying biopsychology ) , to the central nervous system .",0
15845,The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction .,1
15846,"Sometimes , we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to detect a difference between them .",1
15847,This is known as the just noticeable difference ( jnd ) or difference threshold .,0
15848,"Unlike the absolute threshold , the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus intensity .",0
15849,"On the other hand , how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge , our experiences , and our thoughts .",1
15850,This is called top - down processing .,0
15851,"If so , then you have experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a true sensory stimulus and background noise .",0
15852,The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a distracting background is called signal detection theory .,1
15853,This might also explain why a mother is awakened by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep .,0
15854,Two physical characteristics of a wave are amplitude and wavelength ( [ link ] ) .,0
15855,The amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave ( peak or crest ) to the lowest point on the wave ( trough ) .,1
15856,Wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next .,1
15857,The visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see .,1
15858,"As [ link ] shows , the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment and includes gamma rays , x - rays , ultraviolet light , visible light , infrared light , microwaves , and radio waves .",0
15859,This is known as the timbre of a sound .,0
15860,"Timbre refers to a sound ’s purity , and it is affected by the complex interplay of frequency , amplitude , and timing of sound waves .",1
15861,"It serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world , and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye .",0
15862,"The pupil is the small opening in the eye through which light passes , and the size of the pupil can change as a function of light levels as well as emotional arousal .",1
15863,"When light levels are low , the pupil will become dilated , or expanded , to allow more light to enter the eye .",0
15864,The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects .,0
15865,"In a normal - sighted individual , the lens will focus images perfectly on a small indentation in the back of the eye known as the fovea , which is part of the retina , the light - sensitive lining of the eye .",1
15866,The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells ( [ link ] ) .,0
15867,"While cones are concentrated in the fovea , where images tend to be focused , rods , another type of photoreceptor , are located throughout the remainder of the retina .",0
15868,"Rods are specialized photoreceptors that work well in low light conditions , and while they lack the spatial resolution and color function of the cones , they are involved in our vision in dimly lit environments as well as in our perception of movement on the periphery of our visual field .",1
15869,The optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the optic chiasm .,1
15870,"As [ link ] shows , the optic chiasm is an X - shaped structure that sits just below the cerebral cortex at the front of the brain .",0
15871,The trichromatic theory of color vision is not the only theory — another major theory of color vision is known as the opponent - process theory .,0
15872,The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs .,0
15873,"Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity for the nation , secure national borders , and the safety and well - being of citizens .",0
15874,5818 .,0
15875,"The government of the United States can best be described as a republic , or representative democracy .",0
15876,"A democracy is a government in which political power — influence over institutions , leaders , and policies — rests in the hands of the people . In a representative democracy , however , the citizens do not govern directly .",1
15877,"However , in representative governments like the United States , minority rights are protected : people can not be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be .",0
15878,"For example , let ’s say American society decided that atheists , people who do not believe that God exists , were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country .",0
15879,The foremost supporter of elite theory was C. Wright Mills .,0
15880,"In his book , The Power Elite , Mills argued that government was controlled by a combination of business , military , and political elites . C .",0
15881,"According to pluralist theory , people with shared interests will form groups in order to make their desires known to politicians .",1
15882,"These groups include such entities as environmental advocates , unions , and organizations that represent the interests of various businesses .",0
15883,The First Amendment of the Constitution gives Americans the right to express their opinions on matters of concern to them ; the federal government can not interfere with this right .,1
15884,"Because of the Fourteenth Amendment , state governments must protect this right also .",1
15885,"At the same time , neither the federal government nor state governments can allow someone ’s right to free expression to interfere with someone else ’s ability to exercise his or her own rights .",0
15886,Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community .,0
15887,"New York : Simon & Schuster , 75.Putnam argues that a decline in social capital—“the collective value of all ‘ social networks’ [ those whom people know ] and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other ” — accompanies this decline in membership in small , interactive groups . ——— . 1995 .",0
15888,"Therefore , one could be sure that election results were reliable and that the winning candidate had in fact received the votes counted in their favor .",0
15889,Common Cause has also advocated that the Electoral College be done away with and that presidential elections be decided solely on the basis of the popular vote .,0
15890,Such tactics were used successfully in the African American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and remain effective today .,0
15891,"Likewise , the sit - ins ( and sleep - ins and pray - ins ) staged by African American civil rights activists , which they employed successfully to desegregate lunch counters , motels , and churches , have been adopted today by movements such as Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street ( [ link ] ) .",0
15892,"Other tactics , such as boycotting businesses of whose policies the activists disapproved , are also still common .",0
15893,Americans aged 18–29 were less likely to become involved in traditional forms of political activity than older Americans .,0
15894,"A 2015 poll of more than three thousand young adults by Harvard University ’s Institute of Politics revealed that only 22 percent claimed to be politically engaged , and fewer than 10 percent said that they belonged to any type of political organization or had volunteered for a political campaign .",0
15895,"“ Who Votes , Who Does n’t , and Why , ” http://www.people - press.org/2006/10/18/who - votes - who - doesnt - and - why/ .",0
15896,Political involvement also depends on how strongly people feel about current political issues .,0
15897,"Unfortunately , public opinion polls , which politicians may rely on when formulating policy or deciding how to vote on issues , capture only people ’s latent preferences or beliefs .",0
15898,Latent preferences are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time .,0
15899,"Of all the political thinkers who influenced American beliefs about government , the most important is surely John Locke ( [ link ] ) .",0
15900,"The most significant contributions of Locke , a seventeenth - century English philosopher , were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights , which were believed to be God - given rights to life , liberty , and property .",0
15901,"People sacrificed a small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government ’s protection of their lives , liberty , and property .",1
15902,Locke called this implicit agreement between a people and their government the social contract .,0
15903,"Should government deprive people of their rights by abusing the power given to it , the contract was broken and the people were no longer bound by its terms .",0
15904,"All this began to change in 1763 when the Seven Years War between Great Britain and France came to an end , and Great Britain gained control of most of the French territory in North America .",0
15905,"The colonists had fought on behalf of Britain , and many colonists expected that after the war they would be allowed to settle on land west of the Appalachian Mountains that had been taken from France .",0
15906,"The first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the Stamp Act , passed in 1765 , which required that almost all paper goods , such as diplomas , land deeds , contracts , and newspapers , have revenue stamps placed on them .",0
15907,"The outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn , but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts , such as the Townshend Acts ( 1767 ) , which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass , tea , and paint .",1
15908,"New York : Free Press , 95 - 96 .",0
15909,This act of defiance became known as the Boston Tea Party .,0
15910,"Today , many who do not agree with the positions of the Democratic or the Republican Party have organized themselves into an oppositional group dubbed the Tea Party ( [ link ] ) .",0
15911,"In May 1775 , delegates met again in the Second Continental Congress .",0
15912,"By this time , war with Great Britain had already begun , following skirmishes between colonial militiamen and British troops at Lexington and Concord , Massachusetts .",0
15913,"Drafted by Thomas Jefferson , the Declaration of Independence officially proclaimed the colonies’ separation from Britain .",1
15914,"In it , Jefferson eloquently laid out the reasons for rebellion .",0
15915,Many also worried that even a government of representatives elected by the people might become too powerful and overbearing .,0
15916,"Thus , a confederation was created — an entity in which independent , self - governing states form a union for the purpose of acting together in areas such as defense .",1
15917,"Fearful of replacing one oppressive national government with another , however , the framers of the Articles of Confederation created an alliance of sovereign states held together by a weak central government .",0
15918,One of the biggest problems was that the national government had no power to impose taxes .,0
15919,"To avoid any perception of “ taxation without representation , ” the Articles of Confederation allowed only state governments to levy taxes .",0
15920,"In 1786 , Virginia and Maryland invited delegates from the other eleven states to meet in Annapolis , Maryland , for the purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation .",0
15921,"However , only five states sent representatives .",0
15922,Fifty - five delegates arrived in Philadelphia in May 1787 for the meeting that became known as the Constitutional Convention .,0
15923,Many wanted to strengthen the role and authority of the national government but feared creating a central government that was too powerful .,0
15924,Delegates from small states objected to this Virginia Plan .,0
15925,"Another proposal , the New Jersey Plan , called for a unicameral legislature with one house , in which each state would have one vote .",1
15926,The Constitution consists of a preamble and seven articles .,0
15927,"The first three articles divide the national government into three branches — Congress , the executive branch , and the federal judiciary — and describe the powers and responsibilities of each .",0
15928,"The Three - Fifths Compromise , illustrated in [ link ] , resolved the impasse , although not in a manner that truly satisfied anyone .",0
15929,"For purposes of Congressional apportionment , slaveholding states were allowed to count all their free population , including free African Americans and 60 percent ( three - fifths ) of their enslaved population .",0
15930,Neither of these branches had existed under the Articles of Confederation .,0
15931,"Thus , Congress can pass laws , but its power to do so can be checked by the president , who can veto potential legislation so that it can not become a law .",0
15932,"Later , in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison , the U.S. Supreme Court established its own authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws , a process called judicial review .",1
15933,"All powers not expressly given to the national government , however , were intended to be exercised by the states .",1
15934,These powers are known as reserved powers ( [ link ] ) .,0
15935,"Thus , states remained free to pass laws regarding such things as intrastate commerce ( commerce within the borders of a state ) and marriage .",0
15936,This approach to ratification was an unusual one .,0
15937,"Since the authority inherent in the Articles of Confederation and the Confederation Congress had rested on the consent of the states , changes to the nation ’s government should also have been ratified by the state legislatures .",0
15938,John Adams and Thomas Jefferson carried on a lively correspondence regarding the ratification of the Constitution .,0
15939,"In the following excerpt ( reproduced as written ) from a letter dated March 15 , 1789 , after the Constitution had been ratified by nine states but before it had been approved by all thirteen , Jefferson reiterates his previously expressed concerns that a bill of rights to protect citizens’ freedoms was necessary and should be added to the Constitution :",0
15940,"Anti - Federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures , with which they had more contact , could better protect their freedoms .",0
15941,"Although some Anti - Federalists , like Patrick Henry , were wealthy , most distrusted the elite and believed a strong federal government would favor the rich over those of “ the middling sort . ” This was certainly the fear of Melancton Smith , a New York merchant and landowner , who believed that power should rest in the hands of small , landowning farmers of average wealth who “ are more temperate , of better morals and less ambitious than the great.”Isaac Krannick .",0
15942,"Facing considerable opposition to the Constitution in that state , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison , and John Jay wrote a series of essays , beginning in 1787 , arguing for a strong federal government and support of the Constitution ( [ link ] ) .",0
15943,"Later compiled as The Federalist and now known as The Federalist Papers , these eighty - five essays were originally published in newspapers in New York and other states under the name of Publius , a supporter of the Roman Republic .",0
15944,"An aristocracy would not arise , and if it did , its members would have been chosen by lesser men .",0
15945,"Similarly , Jay reminded New Yorkers in Federalist No . 2 that union had been the goal of Americans since the time of the Revolution .",0
15946,"Because these men would be members of a “ transient ” body called together only for the purpose of choosing the president and would meet in separate deliberations in each state , they would be free of corruption and beyond the influence of the “ heats and ferments ” of the voters .",0
15947,"Indeed , Hamilton argued in Federalist No . 70 , instead of being afraid that the president would become a tyrant , Americans should realize that it was easier to control one person than it was to control many .",0
15948,"Responding to charges by Anti - Federalists that the Constitution made the national government too powerful and provided no protections for the rights of individuals , the newly elected federal government tackled the issue of guaranteeing liberties for American citizens .",0
15949,"James Madison , a member of Congress from Virginia , took the lead in drafting nineteen potential changes to the Constitution .",0
15950,The Bill of Rights was intended to quiet the fears of Anti - Federalists that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government .,1
15951,Many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the English Bill of Rights and the Virginia Declaration of Rights .,0
15952,"For example , the right to bear arms for protection ( Second Amendment ) , the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime ( Third Amendment ) , the right to a trial by jury ( Sixth and Seventh Amendments ) , and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment ( Eighth Amendment ) are taken from the English Bill of Rights .",0
15953,"Other liberties , however , do not derive from British precedents .",0
15954,"The protections for religion , speech , the press , and assembly that are granted by the First Amendment did not exist under English law .",0
15955,"( The right to petition the government did , however . )",0
15956,"The Supreme Court , for example , has held that the Ninth Amendment protects the right to privacy even though none of the preceding amendments explicitly mentions this right .",1
15957,"The Tenth Amendment , one of the first submitted to the states for ratification , ensures that states possess all powers not explicitly assigned to the federal government by the Constitution .",1
15958,"This guarantee protects states’ reserved powers to regulate such things as marriage , divorce , and intrastate transportation and commerce , and to pass laws affecting education and public health and safety .",0
15959,"In a time of crisis , like a severe economic depression , the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected , and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation ’s capital quicker than before .",0
15960,"The Twenty - Second Amendment , added in 1955 , limits the president to two terms in office , and the Twenty - Seventh Amendment , first submitted for ratification in 1789 , regulates the implementation of laws regarding salary increases or decreases for members of Congress .",1
15961,"When states began to change property requirements for voters in the 1830s , many that had allowed free , property - owning African American men to vote restricted the suffrage to white men .",0
15962,"The Fifteenth Amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color , but women were still prohibited from voting in most states .",1
15963,"After many years of campaigns for suffrage , as shown in [ link ] , the Nineteenth Amendment finally gave women the right to vote in 1920 .",1
15964,"The Twenty - Third Amendment ( 1961 ) allowed residents of Washington , DC to vote for the president .",1
15965,The Twenty - Fourth Amendment ( 1964 ) abolished the use of poll taxes .,1
15966,"Many southern states had used a poll tax , a tax placed on voting , to prevent poor African Americans from voting .",0
15967,American federalism also seeks to balance the forces of decentralization and centralization .,0
15968,"We see decentralization when we cross state lines and encounter different taxation levels , welfare eligibility requirements , and voting regulations , to name just a few .",0
15969,"In the United States , conflicts between states and the federal government are adjudicated by federal courts , with the U.S. Supreme Court being the final arbiter .",0
15970,"The resolution of such disputes can preserve the autonomy of one level of government , as illustrated recently when the Supreme Court ruled that states can not interfere with the federal government ’s actions relating to immigration . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .",0
15971,"In other instances , a Supreme Court ruling can erode that autonomy , as demonstrated in the 1940s when , in United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. , the Court enabled the federal government to regulate commercial activities that occurred within states , a function previously handled exclusively by the states . United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. , 315 U.S. 110 ( 1942 ) .",0
15972,"In a confederation , authority is decentralized , and the central government ’s ability to act depends on the consent of the subnational governments .",0
15973,"Under the Articles of Confederation ( the first constitution of the United States ) , states were sovereign and powerful while the national government was subordinate and weak .",1
15974,"Because states were reluctant to give up any of their power , the national government lacked authority in the face of challenges such as servicing the war debt , ending commercial disputes among states , negotiating trade agreements with other countries , and addressing popular uprisings that were sweeping the country .",0
15975,"Cambridge , MA : Harvard University Press .",0
15976,"However , when it came time to ratify the Constitution , a number of states requested that an amendment be added explicitly identifying the reserved powers of the states .",0
15977,"What these Anti - Federalists sought was further assurance that the national government ’s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted , which the first ten amendments ( Bill of Rights ) provided .",0
15978,"The Tenth Amendment affirms the states’ reserved powers : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ” Indeed , state constitutions had bills of rights , which the first Congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the Constitution .",0
15979,The most important restriction Section 9 places on the national government prevents measures that cause the deprivation of personal liberty .,0
15980,"Specifically , the government can not suspend the writ of habeas corpus , which enables someone in custody to petition a judge to determine whether that person ’s detention is legal ; pass a bill of attainder , a legislative action declaring someone guilty without a trial ; or enact an ex post facto law , which criminalizes an act retroactively .",0
15981,"The Bill of Rights affirms and expands these constitutional restrictions , ensuring that the government can not encroach on personal freedoms .",0
15982,Various constitutional provisions govern state - to - state relations .,0
15983,"Article IV , Section 1 , referred to as the full faith and credit clause or the comity clause , requires the states to accept court decisions , public acts , and contracts of other states .",0
15984,"Thus , an adoption certificate or driver ’s license issued in one state is valid in any other state .",0
15985,Scores of states considered legislation and ballot initiatives on the question .,0
15986,"The federal courts took up the issue with zeal after the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor struck down the part of DOMA that outlawed federal benefits . United States v. Windsor , 570 U.S. _ _ ( 2013 ) .",0
15987,That move was followed by upwards of forty federal court decisions that upheld marriage equality in particular states .,0
15988,"In 2014 , the Supreme Court decided not to hear several key case appeals from a variety of states , all of which were brought by opponents of marriage equality who had lost in the federal courts .",0
15989,State and local government figures are estimated .,0
15990,Two important developments have fundamentally changed the allocation of revenue since the early 1900s .,0
15991,"First , the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 authorized Congress to impose income taxes without apportioning it among the states on the basis of population , a burdensome provision that Article I , Section 9 , had imposed on the national government . Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co. , 158 U.S. 601 ( 1895 ) .",0
15992,"With this change , the federal government ’s ability to raise revenue significantly increased and so did its ability to spend . The second development regulates federal grants , that is , transfers of federal money to state and local governments .",0
15993,"These transfers , which do not have to be repaid , are designed to support the activities of the recipient governments , but also to encourage them to pursue federal policy objectives they might not otherwise adopt .",0
15994,"In 2009 , President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) , which provided immediate economic - crisis management assistance such as helping local and state economies ride out the Great Recession and shoring up the country ’s banking sector .",1
15995,"A total of $ 274.7 billion in grants , contracts , and loans was allocated to state and local governments under the ARRA.Dilger , “ Federal Grants to State and Local Governments , ” 4 .",0
15996,The bulk of the stimulus funds apportioned to state and local governments was used to create and protect existing jobs through public works projects and to fund various public welfare programs such as unemployment insurance . James Feyrer and Bruce Sacerdote .,0
15997,"For Hamilton , the establishment of the Bank of the United States was fully within Congress ’s authority , and he hoped the bank would foster economic development , print and circulate paper money , and provide loans to the government .",0
15998,"Although Thomas Jefferson , Washington ’s secretary of state , staunchly opposed Hamilton ’s plan on the constitutional grounds that the national government had no authority to create such an instrument , Hamilton managed to convince the reluctant president to sign the legislation .

16000,Were states allowed to tax federal property ?,0
16001,"In McCulloch v. Maryland , Chief Justice John Marshall ( [ link ] ) argued that Congress could create a national bank even though the Constitution did not expressly authorize it . McCulloch v. Maryland , 17 U.S. 316 ( 1819 ) .",0
16002,"Under the necessary and proper clause of Article I , Section 8 , the Supreme Court asserted that Congress could establish “ all means which are appropriate ” to fulfill “ the legitimate ends ” of the Constitution .",0
16003,"In other words , the bank was an appropriate instrument that enabled the national government to carry out several of its enumerated powers , such as regulating interstate commerce , collecting taxes , and borrowing money .",0
16004,Gibbons lost in New York state courts and appealed .,0
16005,Chief Justice Marshall delivered a two - part ruling in favor of Gibbons that strengthened the power of the national government .,0
16006,"First , interstate commerce was interpreted broadly to mean “ commercial intercourse ” among states , thus allowing Congress to regulate navigation .",0
16007,"When President John Adams signed the Sedition Act in 1798 , which made it a crime to speak openly against the government , the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures passed resolutions declaring the act null on the grounds that they retained the discretion to follow national laws .",1
16008,"In effect , these resolutions articulated the legal reasoning underpinning the doctrine of nullification — that states had the right to reject national laws they deemed unconstitutional . W .",0
16009,Kirk Wood .,0
16010,South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the Union .,0
16011,"The federal government responded by enacting the Force Bill in 1833 , authorizing President Jackson to use military force against states that challenged federal tariff laws .",0
16012,"The prospect of military action coupled with the passage of the Compromise Tariff Act of 1833 ( which lowered tariffs over time ) led South Carolina to back off , ending the nullification crisis .",0
16013,The ultimate showdown between national and state authority came during the Civil War .,0
16014,"Prior to the conflict , in Dred Scott v. Sandford , the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories . Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1857 ) .",0
16015,But the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led eleven southern states to secede from the United States because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery .,0
16016,"What was initially a conflict to preserve the Union became a conflict to end slavery when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , freeing all slaves in the rebellious states .",0
16017,"Second , Congress imposed several conditions for readmitting former Confederate states into the Union ; among them was ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .",0
16018,"In sum , after the Civil War the power balance shifted toward the national government , a movement that had begun several decades before with McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) and Gibbons v. Odgen ( 1824 ) .",0
16019,New York : Routledge .,0
16020,"To curtail widespread anticompetitive practices in the railroad industry , Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887 , which created the Interstate Commerce Commission .",1
16021,"Three years later , national regulatory capacity was broadened by the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 , which made it illegal to monopolize or attempt to monopolize and conspire in restraining commerce ( Figure 03_02_Commerce ) .",1
16022,"In the early stages of industrial capitalism , federal regulations were focused for the most part on promoting market competition rather than on addressing the social dislocations resulting from market operations , something the government began to tackle in the 1930s . Eisner , The American Political Economy ; Stephen Skowronek .",0
16023,"For example , New York State passed the Bakeshop Act in 1897 , which prohibited bakery employees from working more than sixty hours in a week .",1
16024,"In Lochner v. New York , the Supreme Court ruled this state regulation that capped work hours unconstitutional , on the grounds that it violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 ( 1905 ) .",0
16025,"In other words , the right to sell and buy labor is a “ liberty of the individual ” safeguarded by the Constitution , the court asserted .",0
16026,"The federal government also took up the issue of working conditions , but that case resulted in the same outcome as in the Lochner case . Hammer v. Dagenhart , 247 U.S. 251 ( 1918 ) .",0
16027,The New Deal programs President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed as a means to tackle the Great Depression ran afoul of the dual - federalism mindset of the justices on the Supreme Court in the 1930s .,0
16028,"The court struck down key pillars of the New Deal — the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act , for example — on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states .",0
16029,"In National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) v. Jones and Laughlin Steel , National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) v. Jones & Laughlin Steel , 301 U.S. 1 ( 1937 ) .",0
16030,"for instance , the Supreme Court ruled the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 constitutional , asserting that Congress can use its authority under the commerce clause to regulate both manufacturing activities and labor - management relations .",1
16031,The New Deal changed the relationship Americans had with the national government .,0
16032,"In the 1960s , President Lyndon Johnson ’s administration expanded the national government ’s role in society even more .",0
16033,"Medicaid ( which provides medical assistance to the indigent ) , Medicare ( which provides health insurance to the elderly and disabled ) , and school nutrition programs were created .",1
16034,"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act ( 1965 ) , the Higher Education Act ( 1965 ) , and the Head Start preschool program ( 1965 ) were established to expand educational opportunities and equality ( [ link ] ) .",0
16035,"Finally , laws were passed to promote urban renewal , public housing development , and affordable housing .",0
16036,"In addition to these Great Society programs , the Civil Rights Act ( 1964 ) and the Voting Rights Act ( 1965 ) gave the federal government effective tools to promote civil rights equality across the country .",0
16037,"During the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon ( 1969–1974 ) and Ronald Reagan ( 1981–1989 ) , attempts were made to reverse the process of nationalization — that is , to restore states’ prominence in policy areas into which the federal government had moved in the past .",0
16038,"New federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency , reduces overall public spending , and improves policy outcomes .",0
16039,"During Nixon ’s administration , general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent .",0
16040,"Several Supreme Court rulings also promoted new federalism by hemming in the scope of the national government ’s power , especially under the commerce clause .",0
16041,"For example , in United States v. Lopez , the court struck down the Gun - Free School Zones Act of 1990 , which banned gun possession in school zones . United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 ( 1995 ) .",1
16042,"It argued that the regulation in question did not “ substantively affect interstate commerce . ” The ruling ended a nearly sixty - year period in which the court had used a broad interpretation of the commerce clause that by the 1960s allowed it to regulate numerous local commercial activities . See Printz v. United States , 521 U.S. 898 ( 1997 ) .",0
16043,Morton Grodzins coined the cake analogy of federalism in the 1950s while conducting research on the evolution of American federalism .,0
16044,"Until then most scholars had thought of federalism as a layer cake , but according to Grodzins the 1930s ushered in “ marble - cake federalism ” ( [ link ] ) : “ The American form of government is often , but erroneously , symbolized by a three - layer cake .",1
16045,Medicaid and the food stamp program are examples of categorical grants .,0
16046,Block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds .,1
16047,"Examples of block grants include the Workforce Investment Act program , which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better - paying jobs , and the Surface Transportation Program , which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways , bridges , tunnels , sidewalks , and bicycle paths .",0
16048,President Clinton vetoed the legislation .,0
16049,"However , congressional efforts to convert Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) to a block grant succeeded .",0
16050,"The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) block grant replaced the AFDC in 1996 , marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program ( which guarantees individual rights to benefits ) into a block grant .",1
16051,Unfunded mandates are federal laws and regulations that impose obligations on state and local governments without fully compensating them for the administrative costs they incur .,1
16052,"The federal government has used mandates increasingly since the 1960s to promote national objectives in policy areas such as the environment , civil rights , education , and homeland security .",0
16053,"The widespread use of federal mandates in the 1970s and 1980s provoked a backlash among state and local authorities , which culminated in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act ( UMRA ) in 1995 .",0
16054,The UMRA ’s main objective has been to restrain the national government ’s use of mandates by subjecting rules that impose unfunded requirements on state and local governments to greater procedural scrutiny .,0
16055,"The Clery Act of 1990 , formally the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act , requires public and private colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs to disclose information about campus crime .",1
16056,"The Act is named after Jeanne Clery , who in 1986 was raped and murdered by a fellow student in her Lehigh University dorm room .",0
16057,Arizona has been one of the states at the forefront of immigration federalism .,0
16058,"In 2010 , it passed Senate Bill 1070 , which sought to make it so difficult for illegal immigrants to live in the state that they would return to their native country , a strategy referred to as “ attrition by enforcement.”Michele Waslin .",0
16059,6031 .,0
16060,"In 2012 , in Arizona v. United States , the Supreme Court affirmed federal supremacy on immigration . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .",0
16061,"The court struck down three of the four central provisions of the Arizona law — namely , those allowing police officers to arrest an undocumented immigrant without a warrant if they had probable cause to think he or she had committed a crime that could lead to deportation , making it a crime to seek a job without proper immigration papers , and making it a crime to be in Arizona without valid immigration papers .",0
16062,"The court upheld the “ show me your papers ” provision , which authorizes police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .",0
16063,"However , in letting this provision stand , the court warned Arizona and other states with similar laws that they could face civil rights lawsuits if police officers applied it based on racial profiling . Julia Preston , “ Arizona Ruling Only a Narrow Opening for Other States , ” New York Times , 25 June 2012 .",0
16064,"All in all , Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s opinion embraced an expansive view of the U.S. government ’s authority to regulate immigration and aliens , describing it as broad and undoubted .",0
16065,"That authority derived from the legislative power of Congress to “ establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization , ” enumerated in the Constitution .",0
16066,"By 2006 , two years after Massachusetts became the first state to recognize marriage equality , twenty - seven states had passed constitutional bans on same - sex marriage .",0
16067,"In United States v. Windsor , the Supreme Court changed the dynamic established by DOMA by ruling that the federal government had no authority to define marriage .",0
16068,"The Court held that states possess the “ historic and essential authority to define the marital relation , ” and that the federal government ’s involvement in this area “ departs from this history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage.”United States v. Windsor , 570 U.S. _ _ ( 2013 ) .",0
16069,The Windsor case gave federal judges the moment of clarity from the U.S. Supreme Court that they needed .,0
16070,"James Esseks , director of the American Civil Liberties Union ’s ( ACLU ) Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender & AIDS Project , summarizes the significance of the case as follows : “ Part of what ’s gotten us to this exciting moment in American culture is not just Edie ’s lawsuit but the story of her life .",0
16071,"The love at the core of that story , as well as the injustice at its end , is part of what has moved America on this issue so profoundly.”James Esseks .",0
16072,The 2014 court decision not to hear a collection of cases from four different states essentially affirmed same - sex marriage in thirty states .,0
16073,And in 2015 the Supreme Court gave same - sex marriage a constitutional basis of right nationwide in Obergefell v. Hodges .,0
16074,"In sum , as the immigration and marriage equality examples illustrate , constitutional disputes have arisen as states and the federal government have sought to reposition themselves on certain policy issues , disputes that the federal courts have had to sort out .",0
16075,By creating two institutional access points — the federal and state governments — the U.S. federal system enables interest groups such as MADD to strategize about how best to achieve their policy objectives .,0
16076,"The term venue shopping refers to a strategy in which interest groups select the level and branch of government ( legislature , judiciary , or executive ) they calculate will be most advantageous for them . Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones .",0

16078,"For example , a number of New Deal breakthroughs , such as child labor laws , were inspired by state policies .",0
16079,"Prior to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment , several states had already granted women the right to vote .",0
16080,California has led the way in establishing standards for fuel emissions and other environmental policies ( [ link ] ) .,0
16081,"More recently , President Obama ’s effort to make health insurance accessible to more Americans under the Affordable Care Act immediately ran into legal challengesNational Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .",0
16082,"from some states , but it has been supported by the Supreme Court so far .",0
16083,"However , the federal government ’s ability to defend the voting rights of citizens suffered a major setback when the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.Shelby County v. Holder , 570 U.S. _ _ ( 2013 ) .",0
16084,No longer are the nine states with histories of racial discrimination in their voting processes required to submit plans for changes to the federal government for approval .,0
16085,"Civil rights , on the other hand , are guarantees that government officials will treat people equally and that decisions will be made on the basis of merit rather than race , gender , or other personal characteristics .",0
16086,"Because of the Constitution ’s civil rights guarantee , it is unlawful for a school or university run by a state government to treat students differently based on their race , ethnicity , age , sex , or national origin .",0
16087,"The Constitution as written in 1787 did not include a Bill of Rights , although the idea of including one was proposed and , after brief discussion , dismissed in the final week of the Constitutional Convention .",0
16088,"The framers of the Constitution believed they faced much more pressing concerns than the protection of civil rights and liberties , most notably keeping the fragile union together in the light of internal unrest and external threats .",0
16089,Prohibition of such laws means that the U.S. Congress can not simply punish people who are unpopular or seem to be guilty of crimes .,0
16090,"An ex post facto law has a retroactive effect : it can be used to punish crimes that were not crimes at the time they were committed , or it can be used to increase the severity of punishment after the fact .",0
16091,Debate has always swirled over these issues .,0
16092,"The Federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of Congress , along with the limitations on those powers in Article I , Section 9 , would suffice , and no separate bill of rights was needed .",0
16093,"Alexander Hamilton , writing as Publius in Federalist No .",0
16094,"However , the Anti - Federalists argued that the Federalists’ position was incorrect and perhaps even insincere .",0
16095,"The Anti - Federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution would allow Congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the Constitution ’s authors ; thus , they held that a bill of rights was necessary .",0
16096,"In the decades following the Constitution ’s ratification , the Supreme Court declined to expand the Bill of Rights to curb the power of the states , most notably in the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore . Barron v. Baltimore , 32 U.S. 243 ( 1833 ) .",0
16097,"In this case , which dealt with property rights under the Fifth Amendment , the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government .",1
16098,"Explaining the court ’s ruling , Chief Justice John Marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that “ the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments ; as well as against that which might be attempted by their [ Federal ] government . ”",0
16099,"In the short term , they advocated suspending civilian government in most of the southern states and replacing politicians who had enacted the black codes .",0
16100,"Their long - term solution was to propose two amendments to the Constitution to guarantee the rights of freed slaves on an equal standing with whites ; these rights became the Fourteenth Amendment , which dealt with civil liberties and rights in general , and the Fifteenth Amendment , which protected the right to vote in particular ( [ link ] ) .",1
16101,"But , the right to vote did not yet apply to women or to Native Americans .",0
16102,"With the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 , civil liberties gained more clarification .",0
16103,"First , the amendment says , “ no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States , ” which is a provision that echoes the privileges and immunities clause in Article IV , Section 2 , of the original Constitution ensuring that states treat citizens of other states the same as their own citizens .",0
16104,"( To use an example from today , the punishment for speeding by an out - of - state driver can not be more severe than the punishment for an in - state driver ) .",0
16105,"Although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically , the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states .",0
16106,"For example , in Sherbert v. Verner ( 1963 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that states could not deny unemployment benefits to an individual who turned down a job because it required working on the Sabbath . Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) .",0
16107,"When the Supreme Court initially decided in 2008 that the Second Amendment protects an individual ’s right to keep and bear arms , it did not decide then that it was a fundamental liberty the states must uphold as well .",0
16108,It was only in the McDonald v. Chicago case two years later that the Supreme Court incorporated the Second Amendment into state law .,0
16109,Another area in which the Supreme Court gradually moved to incorporate the Bill of Rights regards censorship and the Fourteenth Amendment .,0
16110,"The First Amendment is perhaps the most famous provision of the Bill of Rights ; it is arguably also the most extensive , because it guarantees both religious freedoms and the right to express your views in public .",0
16111,"Specifically , the First Amendment says :",0
16112,"The key question that faces the courts is whether the establishment clause should be understood as imposing , in Thomas Jefferson ’s words , “ a wall of separation between church and state . ” In a 1971 case known as Lemon v. Kurtzman , the Supreme Court established the Lemon test for deciding whether a law or other government action that might promote a particular religious practice should be allowed to stand . Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 ( 1971 ) .",0
16113,The Lemon test has three criteria that must be satisfied for such a law or action to be found constitutional and remain in effect :,0
16114,"The rights of conscientious objectors — individuals who claim the right to refuse to perform military service on the grounds of freedom of thought , conscience , or religion — have also been controversial , although many conscientious objectors have contributed service as non - combatant medics during wartime .",0
16115,"To avoid serving in the Vietnam War , many people claimed to have a conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust .",0
16116,"In both Sherbert v. Verner , a case dealing with unemployment compensation , and Wisconsin v. Yoder , which dealt with the right of Amish parents to homeschool their children , the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice , the government must meet two criteria . Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) ; Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205 ( 1972 ) .",0
16117,"It must demonstrate both that it had a “ compelling governmental interest ” in limiting that practice and that the restriction was “ narrowly tailored . ” In other words , it must show there was a very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal .",0
16118,This standard became known as the Sherbert test .,0
16119,"Since the burden of proof in these cases was on the government , the Supreme Court made it very difficult for the federal and state governments to enforce laws against individuals that would infringe upon their religious beliefs .",0
16120,"Such a conflict emerged in the 2014 Supreme Court case known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby . Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. , 573 U.S. _ _ ( 2014 ) .",0
16121,"The Hobby Lobby chain of stores sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores ; its founder , David Green , is a devout fundamentalist Christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion and contraception .",0
16122,"Consistent with these beliefs , he used his business to object to a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA or Obamacare ) requiring employer - backed insurance plans to include no - charge access to the morning - after pill , a form of emergency contraception , arguing that this requirement infringed on his conscience .",0
16123,"Although the remainder of the First Amendment protects four distinct rights — free speech , press , assembly , and petition — we generally think of these rights today as encompassing a right to freedom of expression , particularly since the world ’s technological evolution has blurred the lines between oral and written communication ( i.e. , speech and press ) in the centuries since the First Amendment was written and adopted .",0
16124,"One such person was Gregory Lee Johnson , a member of various pro - communist and antiwar groups .",0
16125,"In 1984 , as part of a protest near the Republican National Convention in Dallas , Texas , Johnson set fire to a U.S. flag that another protestor had torn from a flagpole .",0
16126,Freedom of the press is an important component of the right to free expression as well .,0
16127,"In Near v. Minnesota , an early case regarding press freedoms , the Supreme Court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint ; that is , states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without a very compelling reason . Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .",0
16128,"This standard was reinforced in 1971 in the Pentagon Papers case , in which the Supreme Court found that the government could not prohibit the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers from publishing the Pentagon Papers . New York Times Co. v. United States , 403 U.S. 713 ( 1971 ) .",0
16129,These papers included materials from a secret history of the Vietnam War that had been compiled by the military .,0
16130,"More specifically , the papers were compiled at the request of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and provided a study of U.S. political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967 .",0
16131,"Although people who leak secret information to the media can still be prosecuted and punished , this does not generally extend to reporters and news outlets that pass that information on to the public .",0
16132,The Edward Snowden case is another good case in point .,0
16133,"Despite the ongoing economic recovery , the job market is actually growing in some areas , but in a very polarized fashion .",0
16134,"Polarization means that a gap has developed in the job market , with most employment opportunities at the lowest and highest levels and few jobs for those with midlevel skills and education .",1
16135,"At one end , there has been strong demand for low - skilled , low - paying jobs in industries like food service and retail .",0
16136,"For example , in maquiladoras , mostly found in northern Mexico , workers may sew imported precut pieces of fabric into garments . Globalization also brings an international division of labor , in which comparatively wealthy workers from core nations compete with the low - wage labor pool of peripheral and semi - peripheral nations .",1
16137,"This can lead to a sense of xenophobia , which is an illogical fear and even hatred of foreigners and foreign goods .",1
16138,"Corporations trying to maximize their profits in the United States are conscious of this risk and attempt to “ Americanize ” their products , selling shirts printed with U.S. flags that were nevertheless made in Mexico .",0
16139,"Mechanical solidarity exists in simpler societies where social cohesion comes from sharing similar work , education , and religion .",0
16140,Organic solidarity arises out of the mutual interdependence created by the specialization of work .,1
16141,"The complex U.S. economy , and the economies of other industrialized nations , meet the definition of organic solidarity .",0
16142,Governments tried to protect their share of the markets by developing a system called mercantilism .,0
16143,Mercantilism is an economic policy based on accumulating silver and gold by controlling colonial and foreign markets through taxes and other charges .,1
16144,"The resulting restrictive practices and exacting demands included monopolies , bans on certain goods , high tariffs , and exclusivity requirements .",0
16145,"Socialism is an economic system in which there is government ownership ( often referred to as “ state run ” ) of goods and their production , with an impetus to share work and wealth equally among the members of a society .",1
16146,"Under socialism , everything that people produce , including services , is considered a social product .",0
16147,"Convergence theory explains that as a country 's economy grows , its societal organization changes to become more like that of an industrialized society .",1
16148,"Rather than staying in one job for a lifetime , people begin to move from job to job as conditions improve and opportunities arise .",0
16149,Those working in the symbolic interaction perspective take a microanalytical view of society .,0
16150,They focus on the way reality is socially constructed through day - to - day interaction and how society is composed of people communicating based on a shared understanding of symbols . One important symbolic interactionist concept related to work and the economy is career inheritance .,0
16151,"This concept means simply that children tend to enter the same or similar occupation as their parents , which is a correlation that has been demonstrated in research studies ( Antony 1998 ) .",1
16152,Caste systems are closed stratification systems in which people can do little or nothing to change their social standing .,1
16153,A caste system is one in which people are born into their social standing and will remain in it their whole lives .,1
16154,"People are assigned occupations regardless of their talents , interests , or potential .",0
16155,"Status ConsistencySocial stratification systems determine social position based on factors like income , education , and occupation .",0
16156,"Sociologists use the term status consistency to describe the consistency , or lack thereof , of an individual ’s rank across these factors .",1
16157,"Caste systems correlate with high status consistency , whereas the more flexible class system has lower status consistency .",0
16158,Social MobilitySocial mobility refers to the ability to change positions within a social stratification system .,1
16159,"When people improve or diminish their economic status in a way that affects social class , they experience social mobility .",0
16160,"Dropping out of school , losing a job , or getting a divorce may result in a loss of income or status and , therefore , downward social mobility . It is not uncommon for different generations of a family to belong to varying social classes .",1
16161,This is known as intergenerational mobility .,0
16162,"For example , an upper - class executive may have parents who belonged to the middle class .",0
16163,"Class traits , also called class markers , are the typical behaviors , customs , and norms that define each class .",1
16164,Class traits indicate the level of exposure a person has to a wide range of cultures .,0
16165,"To symbolically communicate social standing , people often engage in conspicuous consumption , which is the purchase and use of certain products to make a social statement about status .",1
16166,Carrying pricey but eco - friendly water bottles could indicate a person ’s social standing .,0
16167,"While stratification in the United States refers to the unequal distribution of resources among individuals , global stratification refers to this unequal distribution among nations .",0
16168,There are two dimensions to this stratification : gaps between nations and gaps within nations .,0
16169,"The poorest , most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America , and Asia .",1
16170,"The second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as China or Cuba .",1
16171,"Later , sociologist Manual Castells ( 1998 ) added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the globe ( indigenous minority populations , prisoners , and the homeless , for example ) .",0
16172,"For example , Wallerstein contends that the United States is an economic powerhouse that can support or deny support to important economic legislation with far - reaching implications , thus exerting control over every aspect of the global economy and exploiting both semi - peripheral and peripheral nations .",0
16173,We can look at free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) as an example of how a core nation is able to leverage its power to gain the most advantageous position in the matter of global trade . Peripheral nations have very little industrialization ; what they do have often represents the outdated castoffs of core nations or the factories and means of production owned by core nations .,0
16174,"They typically have unstable governments , inadequate social programs , and are economically dependent on core nations for jobs and aid .",0
16175,"Some of these countries include the United States , Germany , Canada , and the United Kingdom ( World Bank 2014b).High - income countries face two major issues : capital flight and deindustrialization .",0
16176,"Capital flight refers to the movement ( flight ) of capital from one nation to another , as when General Motors automotive company closed U.S. factories in Michigan and opened factories in Mexico .",1
16177,"Deindustrialization , a related issue , occurs as a consequence of capital flight , as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations .",1
16178,Social scientists define global poverty in different ways and take into account the complexities and the issues of relativism described above .,0
16179,Relative poverty is a state of living where people can afford necessities but are unable to meet their society ’s average standard of living .,1
16180,People often disparage “ keeping up with the Joneses ” — the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors’ standard of living to not feel deprived .,0
16181,"What do the driver of an unlicensed hack cab in New York , a piecework seamstress working from her home in Mumbai , and a street tortilla vendor in Mexico City have in common ?",0
16182,"They are all members of the underground economy , a loosely defined unregulated market unhindered by taxes , government permits , or human protections .",1
16183,Official statistics before the worldwide recession posit that the underground economy accounted for over 50 percent of nonagricultural work in Latin America ; the figure went as high as 80 percent in parts of Asia and Africa ( Chen 2001 ) .,0
16184,"According to modernization theory , low - income countries are affected by their lack of industrialization and can improve their global economic standing through ( Armer and Katsillis 2010):an adjustment of cultural values and attitudes to work",1
16185,"Their labels for racial groups have connoted regions ( Mongolia and the Caucus Mountains , for instance ) or skin tones ( black , white , yellow , and red , for example).Social science organizations including the American Association of Anthropologists , the American Sociological Association , and the American Psychological Association have all taken an official position rejecting the biological explanations of race .",0
16186,"Over time , the typology of race that developed during early racial science has fallen into disuse , and the social construction of race is a more sociological way of understanding racial categories .",0
16187,"Research in this school of thought suggests that race is not biologically identifiable and that previous racial categories were arbitrarily assigned , based on pseudoscience , and used to justify racist practices ( Omi and Winant 1994 ; Graves 2003 ) .",0
16188,"Scapegoat theory , developed initially from Dollard ’s ( 1939 ) Frustration - Aggression theory , suggests that the dominant group will displace its unfocused aggression onto a subordinate group .",1
16189,History has shown us many examples of the scapegoating of a subordinate group .,0
16190,"A prejudice is not based on experience ; instead , it is a prejudgment , originating outside actual experience .",1
16191,"A 1970 documentary called Eye of the Storm illustrates the way in which prejudice develops , by showing how defining one category of people as superior ( children with blue eyes ) results in prejudice against people who are not part of the favored category . While prejudice is not necessarily specific to race , racism is a stronger type of prejudice used to justify the belief that one racial category is somehow superior or inferior to others ; it is also a set of practices used by a racial majority to disadvantage a racial minority .",1
16192,The Ku Klux Klan is an example of a racist organization ; its members ' belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech .,0
16193,"While prejudice refers to biased thinking , discrimination consists of actions against a group of people .",1
16194,"Discrimination can be based on age , religion , health , and other indicators ; race - based laws against discrimination strive to address this set of social problems .",0
16195,"In the days after , it was revealed that only three members of the town ’s fifty - three - member police force were black ( Nobles and Bosman 2014 ) .",0
16196,"The national dialogue shifted during the next few weeks , with some commentators pointing to a nationwide sedimentation of racial inequality and identifying redlining in Ferguson as a cause of the unbalanced racial composition in the community , in local political establishments , and in the police force ( Bouie 2014 ) .",0
16197,"Redlining is the practice of routinely refusing mortgages for households and businesses located in predominately minority communities , while sedimentation of racial inequality describes the intergenerational impact of both practical and legalized racism that limits the abilities of black people to accumulate wealth .",1
16198,Culture of prejudice refers to the theory that prejudice is embedded in our culture .,1
16199,We grow up surrounded by images of stereotypes and casual expressions of racism and prejudice .,0
16200,"Segregation refers to the physical separation of two groups , particularly in residence , but also in workplace and social functions .",1
16201,It is important to distinguish between de jure segregation ( segregation that is enforced by law ) and de facto segregation ( segregation that occurs without laws but because of other factors ) .,1
16202,Amalgamation is the process by which a minority group and a majority group combine to form a new group .,1
16203,"Amalgamation creates the classic “ melting pot ” analogy ; unlike the “ salad bowl , ” in which each culture retains its individuality , the “ melting pot ” ideal sees the combination of cultures that results in a new culture entirely . Amalgamation , also known as miscegenation , is achieved through intermarriage between races .",0
16204,"Sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females , including both primary sex characteristics ( the reproductive system ) and secondary characteristics such as height and muscularity .",1
16205,"Gender refers to behaviors , personal traits , and social positions that society attributes to being female or male . A person ’s sex , as determined by his or her biology , does not always correspond with his or her gender .",1
16206,"Therefore , the terms sex and gender are not interchangeable .",0
16207,Much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and misinformation .,0
16208,"Some is based on heterosexism , which Herek ( 1990 ) suggests is both an ideology and a set of institutional practices that privilege heterosexuals and heterosexuality over other sexual orientations .",1
16209,"Much like racism and sexism , heterosexism is a systematic disadvantage embedded in our social institutions , offering power to those who conform to hetereosexual orientation while simultaneously disadvantaging those who do not .",0
16210,"To a certain extent , men can assume some feminine roles and women can assume some masculine roles without interfering with their gender identity .",0
16211,Gender identity is a person ’s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender .,1
16212,Individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called transgender .,1
16213,"Gender Dysphoria , on the other hand , removes some of that stigma by taking the word """" disorder """" out while maintaining a category that will protect patient access to care , including hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery .",0
16214,"In the DSM-5 , Gender Dysphoria is a condition of people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with .",1
16215,"For a person to be diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria , there must be a marked difference between the individual ’s expressed / experienced gender and the gender others would assign him or her , and it must continue for at least six months .",0
16216,"In other words , both gender and sexuality are socially constructed .",0
16217,The social construction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex - linked behavior shape the way people see and experience sexuality .,1
16218,"This is in marked contrast to theories of sex , gender , and sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism , or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology .",0
16219,Queer TheoryQueer Theory is an interdisciplinary approach to sexuality studies that identifies Western society ’s rigid splitting of gender into male and female roles and questions the manner in which we have been taught to think about sexual orientation .,1
16220,"According to Jagose ( 1996 ) , Queer [ Theory ] focuses on mismatches between anatomical sex , gender identity , and sexual orientation , not just division into male / female or homosexual / hetereosexual .",0
16221,Gerontology is a field of science that seeks to understand the process of aging and the challenges encountered as seniors grow older .,1
16222,"Gerontologists investigate age , aging , and the aged .",0
16223,Each person experiences age - related changes based on many factors .,0
16224,"Biological factors such as molecular and cellular changes are called primary aging , while aging that occurs due to controllable factors such as lack of physical exercise and poor diet is called secondary aging ( Whitbourne and Whitbourne 2010 ) .",1
16225,Should patients have the right to choose to die with dignity ?,0
16226,Dr. Jack Kevorkian was a staunch advocate for physician - assisted suicide : the voluntary or physician - assisted use of lethal medication provided by a medical doctor to end one ’s life .,1
16227,This right to have a doctor help a patient die with dignity is controversial .,0
16228,"He did n’t intend to treat people differently based on personal or cultural biases , but he did .",0
16229,Ageism is discrimination ( when someone acts on a prejudice ) based on age .,1
16230,"Dr. Robert Butler coined the term in 1968 , noting that ageism exists in all cultures ( Brownell ) .",0
16231,There are three classic theories of aging within the conflict perspective .,0
16232,Modernization theory ( Cowgill and Holmes 1972 ) suggests that the primary cause of the elderly losing power and influence in society are the parallel forces of industrialization and modernization .,1
16233,"As societies modernize , the status of elders decreases , and they are increasingly likely to experience social exclusion .",0
16234,"One microanalytical theory is Rose ’s ( 1962 ) subculture of aging theory , which focuses on the shared community created by the elderly when they are excluded ( due to age ) , voluntarily or involuntarily , from participating in other groups .",1
16235,This theory suggests that elders will disengage from society and develop new patterns of interaction with peers who share common backgrounds and interests .,0
16236,A family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born .,0
16237,A family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage .,0
16238,"These distinctions have cultural significance related to issues of lineage . Drawing on two sociological paradigms , the sociological understanding of what constitutes a family can be explained by symbolic interactionism as well as functionalism .",0
16239,"In many countries and cultures around the world , however , having one spouse is not the only form of marriage .",0
16240,"In a majority of cultures ( 78 percent ) , polygamy , or being married to more than one person at a time , is accepted ( Murdock 1967 ) , with most polygamous societies existing in northern Africa and east Asia ( Altman and Ginat 1996 ) .",1
16241,Instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of polygyny .,0
16242,"In the United States , polygamy is considered by most to be socially unacceptable and it is illegal .",0
16243,The act of entering into marriage while still married to another person is referred to as bigamy and is considered a felony in most states .,1
16244,"Polygamy in the United States is often associated with those of the Mormon faith , although in 1890 the Mormon Church officially renounced polygamy .",0
16245,"Sixty percent of societies , mostly modernized nations , follow a bilateral descent pattern .",0
16246,"Unilateral descent ( the tracing of kinship through one parent only ) is practiced in the other 40 percent of the world ’s societies , with high concentration in pastoral cultures ( O’Neal 2006 ) .",1
16247,Patrilocal residence is thought to be disadvantageous to women because it makes them outsiders in the home and community ; it also keeps them disconnected from their own blood relatives .,0
16248,"In China , where patrilocal and patrilineal customs are common , the written symbols for maternal grandmother ( wáipá ) are separately translated to mean “ outsider ” and “ women ” ( Cohen 2011).Similarly , in matrilocal residence systems , where it is customary for the husband to live with his wife ’s blood relatives ( or her family of orientation ) , the husband can feel disconnected and can be labeled as an outsider .",1
16249,"The Minangkabau people , a matrilocal society that is indigenous to the highlands of West Sumatra in Indonesia , believe that home is the place of women and they give men little power in issues relating to the home or family ( Joseph and Najmabadi 2003 ) .",0
16250,This is a decrease from 77 percent in 1980 ( U.S. Census 2011 ) .,0
16251,"This two - parent family structure is known as a nuclear family , referring to married parents and children as the nucleus , or core , of the group .",1
16252,Recent years have seen a rise in variations of the nuclear family with the parents not being married .,0
16253,Religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to “ the divine . ” This type of communion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate .,1
16254,"Religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true , such as that Jesus Christ was the son of God , or that reincarnation exists .",1
16255,Another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions .,0
16256,"The term ecclesia , originally referring to a political assembly of citizens in ancient Athens , Greece , now refers to a congregation .",0
16257,"In sociology , the term is used to refer to a religious group that most all members of a society belong to .",1
16258,"Similarly , many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism ’s godhead as polytheistic , which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities , , while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity .",1
16259,"Some Japanese practice Shinto , which follows animism , which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings .",1
16260,"It is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers , such as atheists , who do not believe in a divine being or entity , and agnostics , who hold that ultimate reality ( such as God ) is unknowable .",1
16261,"A megachurch is a Christian church that has a very large congregation averaging more than 2,000 people who attend regular weekly services .",1
16262,"As of 2009 , the largest megachurch in the United States was in Houston Texas , boasting an average weekly attendance of more than 43,000 ( Bogan 2009 ) .",0
16263,"In contrast , informal education describes learning about cultural values , norms , and expected behaviors by participating in a society .",1
16264,This type of learning occurs both through the formal education system and at home .,0
16265,Education also provides one of the major methods used by people for upward social mobility .,0
16266,This function is referred to as social placement .,0
16267,College and graduate schools are viewed as vehicles for moving students closer to the careers that will give them the financial freedom and security they seek .,0
16268,Many argue that the tests group students by cultural ability rather than by natural intelligence .,0
16269,"The cycle of rewarding those who possess cultural capital is found in formal educational curricula as well as in the hidden curriculum , which refers to the type of nonacademic knowledge that students learn through informal learning and cultural transmission .",1
16270,This hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally .,0
16271,The labeling with which symbolic interactionists concern themselves extends to the very degrees that symbolize completion of education .,0
16272,"Credentialism embodies the emphasis on certificates or degrees to show that a person has a certain skill , has attained a certain level of education , or has met certain job qualifications .",1
16273,"These certificates or degrees serve as a symbol of what a person has achieved , and allows the labeling of that individual .",0
16274,"opined , “ The measure of a man is what he does with power , ” and Lord Acton perhaps more famously asserted , “ Power tends to corrupt ; absolute power corrupts absolutely ” ( 1887 ) .",0
16275,"Indeed , the concept of power can have decidedly negative connotations , and the term itself is difficult to define . Many scholars adopt the definition developed by German sociologist Max Weber , who said that power is the ability to exercise one ’s will over others ( Weber 1922 ) .",1
16276,"Power affects more than personal relationships ; it shapes larger dynamics like social groups , professional organizations , and governments .",0
16277,"Most people generally agree that anarchy , or the absence of organized government , does not facilitate a desirable living environment for society , but it is much harder for individuals to agree upon the particulars of how a population should be governed .",1
16278,"Throughout history , various forms of government have evolved to suit the needs of changing populations and mindsets , each with pros and cons .",0
16279,"In today ’s global political climate , monarchies far more often take the form of constitutional monarchies , governments of nations that recognize monarchs but require these figures to abide by the laws of a greater constitution .",1
16280,Many countries that are now constitutional monarchies evolved from governments that were once considered absolute monarchies .,0
16281,"The late Kim Jong - Il , North Korean dictator , and his successor , Kim Jong - Un , exemplify this type of charismatic dictatorship . Some dictatorships do not align themselves with any particular belief system or ideology ; the goal of this type of regime is usually limited to preserving the authority of the dictator .",0
16282,"A totalitarian dictatorship is even more oppressive and attempts to control all aspects of its subjects’ lives ; including occupation , religious beliefs , and number of children permitted in each family .",1
16283,Citizens may be forced to publicly demonstrate their faith in the regime by participating in marches and demonstrations .,0
16284,Political science looks at politics as the interaction between citizens and their government .,0
16285,Sociology studies politics as a means to understand the underlying social norms and values of a group .,1
16286,It matters because the support of farmers in high - income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in low - income countries .,0
16287,"Even when their climate and land are well - suited to products like cotton , rice , sugar , or milk , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to compete .",0
16288,U.S. producers obtain a higher price so they sell a larger quantity of sugar .,0
16289,"The effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States can be measured using two concepts developed in Demand , Supply , and Efficiency : consumer surplus and producer surplus . U.S .",0
16290,"Sugar Supply and Demand When there is free trade , the equilibrium is at point A .",0
16291,Lost sales translate into lost jobs .,0
16292,The hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries .,0
16293,"This is why the United States International Trade Commission , in its study of barriers to trade , predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs .",0
16294,Workers in many low - income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for a worker in the United States .,0
16295,"Workers in countries like China , Thailand , Brazil , South Africa , and Poland are often paid less than the United States minimum wage .",0
16296,"For example , in the United States , the minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour ; a typical wage in many low - income countries might be more like $ 7.25 per day , or often much less .",0
16297,Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production .,1
16298,Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production .,1
16299,"Since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO .",0
16300,"In general , high - income countries such as the United States , Canada , Japan , and the nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards .",0
16301,"In contrast , middle- and low - income countries like Brazil , Nigeria , India , and China have lower environmental standards .",0
16302,One final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument skeptically is that almost any product can be touted by lobbyists and politicians as vital to national security .,0
16303,"In 1954 , the United States became worried that it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms , so it declared wool and mohair to be “ strategic materials ” and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers .",0
16304,"There are different types of economic integration across the globe , ranging from free trade agreements , in which participants allow each other ’s imports without tariffs or quotas , to common markets , in which participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group , to full economic unions , in which , in addition to a common market , monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated .",1
16305,Many nations belong both to the World Trade Organization and to regional trading agreements .,0
16306,Because of Technotron ’s new technology — which in this case is importing goods from another county — other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers .,0
16307,"Just as it would have been inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific technology by trying to shut it down , it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of international trade by trying to restrict trade .",0
16308,"To a mathematician or an economist , a variable is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values .",1
16309,"In the equation of a line presented above , x and y are the variables , with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis , and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line .",0
16310,"A negative slope means that two variables are negatively related ; that is , when x increases , y decreases , or when x decreases , y increases .",1
16311,"Graphically , a negative slope means that , as the line on the line graph moves from left to right , the line falls .",0
16312,The data in [ link ] is displayed in [ link ] which shows the relationship between two variables : length and median weight for American baby boys and girls during the first three years of life .,0
16313,( The median means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half weigh less . ),0
16314,The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis .,0
16315,A bar graph uses the height of different bars to compare quantities .,1
16316,[ link ] lists the 12 most populous countries in the world .,0
16317,"For example , points A and B sit on the same indifference curve Um , which means that they provide Lilly with the same level of utility .",0
16318,"Thus , the marginal utility that Lilly would gain from , say , increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84—so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B .",0
16319,"Indeed , the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution , which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same .",1
16320,This information provides the basis for the budget line shown in [ link ] .,0
16321,Along with the budget line are shown the three indifference curves from [ link ] .,0
16322,What is Lilly ’s utility - maximizing choice ?,0
16323,"If oranges get cheaper , people fire up their juicing machines and ease off on other fruits and foods .",0
16324,The income effect refers to how a change in the price of a good alters the effective buying power of one ’s income .,1
16325,"If the price of a good that you have been buying falls , then in effect your buying power has risen — you are able to purchase more goods .",0
16326,"As explained in Financial Markets , the prices of stocks and bonds depend on future events .",0
16327,"The price of a bond depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make , including both payments of interest and the repayment of the face value of the bond .",0
16328,"All sales of the final goods and services that make up GDP will eventually end up as income for workers , for managers , and for investors and owners of firms .",0
16329,The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is called national income ( Y ) .,1
16330,"At some points in the discussion that follows , it will be useful to refer to real GDP as “ national income . ” Both axes are measured in real ( inflation - adjusted ) terms .",0
16331,"The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure - output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule , which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP .",1
16332,"The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line — at point E0 in [ link]—will show the equilibrium for the economy , because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP .",0
16333,"( Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important , because even low - income societies are not literally at zero income , so the point is hypothetical . )",0
16334,"This relationship between income and consumption , illustrated in [ link ] and [ link ] , is called the consumption function .",1
16335,"All the components of aggregate demand — consumption , investment , government spending , and the trade balance — are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram .",0
16336,"[ link ] builds up an aggregate expenditure function , based on the numerical illustrations of C , I , G , X , and M that have been used throughout this text .",0
16337,"The meaning of “ equilibrium ” remains the same ; that is , equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome .",1
16338,"To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium , consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E , say point H in [ link ] , where output is higher than the equilibrium .",0
16339,"In this way , the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once .",0
16340,"This is called the multiplier effect : An initial increase in spending , cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent .",1
16341,The equilibrium price is $ 80 and the equilibrium quantity is 28 million .,0
16342,"To see the benefits to consumers , look at the segment of the demand curve above the equilibrium point and to the left .",0
16343,This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some demanders would have been willing to pay more than $ 80 for a tablet .,0
16344,The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller ’s actual cost is called producer surplus .,1
16345,"In [ link ] , producer surplus is the area labeled G — that is , the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium . The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus , also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus .",1
16346,"In [ link ] , social surplus would be shown as the area F + G. Social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity .",0
16347,"The new consumer surplus is G , and the new producer surplus is H + I .",0
16348,Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity .,1
16349,"These can be individual decisions , family decisions , business decisions or societal decisions .",0
16350,"Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith , but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way .",0
16351,"In the first chapter , Smith introduces the division of labor , which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers , instead of all the tasks being done by the same person .",1
16352,How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals ?,0
16353,"Monetary policy , which involves policies that affect bank lending , interest rates , and financial capital markets , is conducted by a nation ’s central bank .",1
16354,"For the United States , this is the Federal Reserve .",0
16355,"They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior , that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use .",0
16356,A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other .,1
16357,"The purpose of a theory is to take a complex , real - world issue and simplify it down to its essentials .",0
16358,"A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram , which is shown in [ link ] .",0
16359,It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups — households and firms — that interact in two markets : the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees .,1
16360,"Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions , market economies have a very decentralized structure .",0
16361,"A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services , who may be either individuals or businesses .",1
16362,"The New York Stock Exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together .",0
16363,Exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad .,1
16364,Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .,1
16365,The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .,1
16366,Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired .,1
16367,"The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else ; in short , opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative .",0
16368,People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide .,0
16369,"Utility , as we will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices , is subjective but that does not make it less real .",0
16370,"Just as individuals can not have everything they want and must instead make choices , society as a whole can not have everything it might want , either .",0
16371,"This section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society , using a model called the production possibilities frontier ( PPF ) .",0
16372,There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice .,0
16373,"This pattern is common enough that it has been given a name : the law of diminishing returns , which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose , the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline .",1
16374,"When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime , for example , the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large .",0
16375,Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires .,1
16376,"How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question , and is usually discussed in political science , sociology , and philosophy classes as well as in economics .",0
16377,"Rather , it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists .",0
16378,"Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements , which describe the world as it is , and normative statements , which describe how the world should be .",0
16379,"For example , an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city .",0
16380,"But even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts , scarcity remains — just at a different level .",0
16381,The second theme is tradeoffs .,0
16382,"As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier , it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good .",0
16383,"Finally , the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices .",0
16384,"An economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college , and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today .",0
16385,Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price .,1
16386,The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .,1
16387,"The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .",1
16388,"An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .",1
16389,Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .,1
16390,"Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] .",1
16391,Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45 .,0
16392,Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight - line demand curve .,0
16393,"Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity , as depicted in [ link ] refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price , no matter how large , results in zero change in quantity .",1
16394,"While a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example , goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves .",0
16395,"The example of cigarette taxes showed that because demand is inelastic , taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking , and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices .",0
16396,"The analysis , or manner , of how the burden of a tax is divided between consumers and producers is called tax incidence .",1
16397,"Typically , the incidence , or burden , of a tax falls both on the consumers and producers of the taxed good .",0
16398,The cross - price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas .,0
16399,The term “ cross - price ” refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good .,1
16400,Let ’s define what is meant by the firm .,0
16401,"A firm ( or business ) combines inputs of labor , capital , land , and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs .",1
16402,"If the firm is successful , the outputs are more valuable than the inputs .",0
16403,We can distinguish between two types of cost : explicit and implicit .,0
16404,"Explicit costs are out - of - pocket costs , that is , payments that are actually made .",1
16405,Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs .,0
16406,It means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out .,0
16407,"Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost , including both explicit and implicit costs .",1
16408,"The difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit , whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit .",0
16409,"Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of production , at least not in the short term .",1
16410,"Whether you produce a lot or a little , the fixed costs are the same .",0
16411,Average total cost ( sometimes referred to simply as average cost ) is total cost divided by the quantity of output .,1
16412,"Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $ 320 , the average total cost for producing each of 40 haircuts is $ 320/40 , or $ 8 per haircut .",0
16413,"Finally , the right - hand portion of the long - run average cost curve , running from output level Q4 to Q5 , shows a situation where , as the level of output and the scale rises , average costs rise as well .",1
16414,This situation is called diseconomies of scale .,0
16415,"A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage , resulting in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other , and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials .",0
16416,What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price .,1
16417,The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded .,1
16418,"When economists talk about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price .",1
16419,Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .,1
16420,"A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied .",0
16421,"Like demand , supply can be illustrated using a table or a graph .",0
16422,"A supply schedule is a table , like [ link ] , that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices .",1
16423,"Again , price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons .",0
16424,"The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium .",1
16425,"The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity .",1
16426,"When the price is below equilibrium , there is excess demand , or a shortage — that is , at the given price the quantity demanded , which has been stimulated by the lower price , now exceeds the quantity supplied , which had been depressed by the lower price .",1
16427,"In this situation , eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations , only to find many stations running short of fuel .",0
16428,"The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing .",1
16429,"Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus , a Latin phrase meaning “ other things being equal . ” Any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal .",0
16430,"A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two , and only two , variables when all other variables are kept constant .",0
16431,The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising .,0
16432,"It rose from 9.8 % in 1970 to 12.6 % in 2000 , and will be a projected ( by the U.S. Census Bureau ) 20 % of the population by 2030 .",0
16433,These changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve .,0
16434,"Therefore , a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor ( other than price ) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price .",0
16435,The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens .,0
16436,"For example , in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China , which produces most of the country 's wheat , corn , and soybeans , experienced its most severe drought in 50 years .",0
16437,"A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products , which means that at any given price , a lower quantity will be supplied ; conversely , especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right . When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost , the supply curve will shift to the right , as well .",0
16438,"For instance , in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice .",0
16439,"“ Well , it is clear that a drought reduces supply , so I will shift back the supply curve , as in the shift from the original supply curve S0 to S1 shown on the diagram ( called Shift 1 ) .",0
16440,"So the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1 , the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher .",0
16441,"Then , a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good , so the supply curve shifts right , as shown by the shift from S1 to S2 , on the diagram ( shown as Shift 2 ) , so that the equilibrium now moves from E1 to E2 .",0
16442,"The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product , adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be .",0
16443,"According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013 , the European Union ( EU ) will spend about 60 billion euros per year , or 67 billion dollars per year , or roughly 38 % of the EU budget , on price supports for Europe ’s farmers from 2014 to 2020 .",0
16444,[ link ] illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in Europe .,0
16445,"In the absence of government intervention , the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0 , with price P0 and quantity Q0 .",0
16446,"At that above - equilibrium salary , excess supply or a surplus results .",0
16447,"In a situation of excess supply in the labor market , with many applicants for every job opening , employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have .",0
16448,"Nurses’ salary will move down toward equilibrium . In contrast , if the salary is below the equilibrium at , say , $ 60,000 per year , then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises .",0
16449,"In mid-2009 , the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $ 7.25 per hour .",0
16450,"Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage , which they call a living wage .",0
16451,Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living .,0
16452,The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets .,0
16453,"According to the law of demand , a higher rate of return ( that is , a higher price ) will decrease the quantity demanded .",1
16454,"As the interest rate rises , consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow .",0
16455,"Instead , each consumer reacts according to that person ’s preferences and budget set , and each profit - seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits .",0
16456,The following Clear It Up feature examines the demand and supply models .,0
16457,"To understand how a household will make its choices , economists look at what consumers can afford , as shown in a budget constraint line , and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices .",0
16458,"In a budget constraint line , the quantity of one good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis .",1
16459,"The most common pattern of total utility , as shown here , is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility , but at a decreasing rate .",0
16460,"The third column shows marginal utility , which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption .",1
16461,"This equation for marginal utility is : MU = change in total utilitychange in quantityMU = change in total utilitychange in quantityNotice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed , which means that each subsequent unit of a good consumed provides less additional utility .",0
16462,This process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when maximizing utility .,0
16463,"Since the price of T - shirts is twice as high as the price of movies , to maximize utility the last T - shirt chosen needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility ( MU ) of the last movie .",0
16464,How does this rise in income alter her utility - maximizing choice ?,0
16465,Kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek her utility - maximizing choice on the new budget line .,0
16466,But how will her new choice relate to her original choice ?,0
16467,"This occurs for two reasons , and both effects can occur simultaneously .",0
16468,The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price .,1
16469,"The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) .",1
16470,"Again , let ’s proceed with a concrete example .",0
16471,"The economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a consumption choice budget constraint , but the labels are different on a labor - leisure budget constraint .",0
16472,[ link ] and [ link ] show Yelberton ’s intertemporal budget constraint .,0
16473,Yelberton ’s choice involves comparing the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after retirement .,0
16474,"And what ’s more , actions under these conditions are indeed predictable , if the underlying environment is better understood .",0
16475,"So , behavioral economics seeks to enrich the understanding of decision - making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics .",1
16476,It does this by investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation .,0
16477,"Industries differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market , how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter , and the type of products that are sold .",1
16478,This is referred to as the market structure of the industry .,0
16479,"In this chapter , we focus on perfect competition .",0
16480,"A perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to make — namely , what quantity to produce .",0
16481,"To understand why this is so , consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of profit :",0
16482,"In this example , the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at a price of $ 4 and a quantity of 80 produced .",0
16483,"If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60 , and then experimented with increasing production to 70 , marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs — and so profits would rise .",0
16484,No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price .,0
16485,"However , the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market .",0
16486,"For an increasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a higher price than before .",1
16487,"Here companies may have to deal with limited inputs , such as skilled labor .",0
16488,"To explore what is meant by allocative efficiency , it is useful to walk through an example .",0
16489,"Begin by assuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive , and so P = MC .",0
16490,"There are two types of monopoly , based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit .",0
16491,"One is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition .",1
16492,"The other is legal monopoly , where laws prohibit ( or severely limit ) competition .",1
16493,Copyright Office .,0
16494,"A patent gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time ; in the United States , exclusive patent rights last for 20 years .",1
16495,"The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their investment in R&D , but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires .",0
16496,"But in certain areas , like the invention of new software , it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection should apply .",0
16497,There is also a body of law known as trade secrets .,0
16498,"Even if a company does not have a patent on an invention , competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets .",0
16499,Businesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential competitors from entering the market .,0
16500,"One method is known as predatory pricing , in which a firm uses the threat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition .",1
16501,"Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law , but it is difficult to prove .",0
16502,"For a perfect competitor , each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal revenue , because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price .",0
16503,But a monopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in total revenue .,0
16504,"When a monopolist increases sales by one unit , it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit , but also loses some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at a lower price .",0
16505,"A perfectly competitive market has many firms selling identical products , who all act as price takers in the face of the competition .",0
16506,"If you recall , price takers are firms that have no market power .",1
16507,They simply have to take the market price as given .,0
16508,"Crew , and Nordstrom ’s ) , plus 14 more stores that sold women ’s specialty clothing ( like Motherhood Maternity and Victoria ’s Secret ) .",0
16509,Most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically competitive . The other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly .,0
16510,Oligopolistic markets are those dominated by a small number of firms .,1
16511,"Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee of satisfaction or money back , a reputation for high quality , services like free delivery , or offering a loan to purchase the product .",0
16512,"Finally , product differentiation may occur in the minds of buyers .",0
16513,"For example , many people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of beer or cigarettes if they were blindfolded but , because of past habits and advertising , they have strong preferences for certain brands .",0
16514,"Although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions , two differences are worth remembering .",0
16515,"First , although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward - sloping demand curves , the monopolist ’s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve , while the perceived demand curve for a monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces .",0
16516,"Second , a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry , but a monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar , but differentiated , products .",0
16517,"Thus , although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term , the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run .",0
16518,Remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero accounting profit .,0
16519,A zero economic profit means the firm ’s accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use .,1
16520,"Rather , they are oligopolies .",0
16521,Oligopoly arises when a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry .,1
16522,"Examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry , cable television , and commercial air travel .",0
16523,"By acting together , oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output , charge a higher price , and divide up the profit among themselves .",0
16524,"When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion .",1
16525,A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel .,1
16526,The desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists .,0
16527,"Adam Smith wrote in Wealth of Nations in 1776 : “ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ”",0
16528,"Each oligopolist , however , must worry that while it is holding down output , other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits .",0
16529,[ link ] shows the prisoner ’s dilemma for a two - firm oligopoly — known as a duopoly .,1
16530,"If Firms A and B both agree to hold down output , they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn $ 1,000 in profits .",0
16531,"One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve , in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts , but not price increases .",1
16532,This situation is shown in [ link ] .,0
16533,A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm .,0
16534,"When one firm purchases another , it is called an acquisition .",1
16535,"In many cases , these large firms were organized in the legal form of a “ trust , ” in which a group of formerly independent firms were consolidated together by mergers and purchases , and a group of “ trustees ” then ran the companies as if they were a single firm .",1
16536,"Thus , when the U.S. government passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 to limit the power of these trusts , it was called an antitrust law .",0
16537,"In an early demonstration of the law ’s power , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government ’s right to break up Standard Oil , which had controlled about 90 % of the country ’s oil refining , into 34 independent firms , including Exxon , Mobil , Amoco , and Chevron .",0
16538,Regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry .,0
16539,"An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms .",1
16540,"For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy , refer to Monopoly . Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market .",1
16541,Defining a market is often controversial .,0
16542,"For example , Microsoft in the early 2000s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating systems .",0
16543,"Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition .",1
16544,"Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price .",0
16545,Tying sales happen when a customer is required to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second product .,1
16546,Tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not actually want or need .,0
16547,All sides agreed that the capabilities of computer software that was compatible with Windows — both software produced by Microsoft and that produced by other companies — had expanded dramatically in the 1990s .,0
16548,"Having a monopoly or a near - monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself , but in cases where one company controls a great deal of the market , antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care .",0
16549,The regulators will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest .,0
16550,"Point C illustrates one tempting choice : the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8 , and charge the price of 3.5 , which is equal to marginal cost at that point .",0
16551,"This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost , which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market , and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice A .",0
16552,"Beginning in the 1970s , it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price regulation was not working well .",0
16553,"The United States carried out a great policy experiment — the deregulation discussed in Monopoly — removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines , railroads , trucking , intercity bus travel , natural gas , and bank interest rates .",1
16554,The Clear it Up discusses the outcome of deregulation in one industry in particular — airlines . What are the results of airline deregulation ?,0
16555,"The collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of Lehman Brothers , a major investment bank , numerous large commercial banks , such as Wachovia , and even the Federal National Mortgage Corporation ( Fannie Mae ) , which had to be nationalized — that is , taken over by the federal government .",1
16556,"One response to the financial crisis was the Dodd - Frank Act , which attempted major reforms of the financial system .",0
16557,"The legislation ’s purpose , as noted on dodd-frank.com is :",0
16558,The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an externality .,1
16559,"Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .",0
16560,"If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .",0
16561,Pollution is a negative externality .,0
16562,Economists illustrate the social costs of production with a demand and supply diagram .,0
16563,The social costs include the private costs of production incurred by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society .,1
16564,"However , when the externality of pollution exists , the supply curve no longer represents all social costs .",0
16565,"Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs , but only some of them , economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure .",0
16566,"When there is market failure , the private market fails to achieve efficient output , because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained ( a positive externality ) .",1
16567,"In the same year , the Clean Air Act was enacted to address air pollution .",0
16568,"Just two years later , in 1972 , Congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching Clean Water Act .",0
16569,"These command - and - control environmental laws , and their amendments and updates , have been largely responsible for America ’s cleaner air and water in recent decades .",0
16570,When a city or state government sets up a marketable permit program ( e.g .,0
16571,"cap - and - trade ) , it must start by determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards .",0
16572,"However , it also found that a middle - range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was $ 22 trillion — about 44 times higher than the costs .",0
16573,A more recent study by the EPA estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans from the Clean Air Act will exceed their costs by a margin of four to one .,0
16574,The EPA estimated that “ in 2010 the benefits of Clean Air Act programs will total about $ 110 billion .,0
16575,"However , as the extent of environmental protection increases , the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease , and more costly methods must be used .",0
16576,The marginal cost curve rises .,0
16577,"Also , as environmental protection increases , the largest marginal benefits are achieved first , followed by reduced marginal benefits .",0
16578,"However , low - income countries , with some understandable exasperation , point out that high - income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of economic growth .",0
16579,"After all , high - income countries have historically been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning fossil fuels — and still are today .",0
16580,"It is hard to tell people who are living in a low - income country , where adequate diet , health care , and education are lacking , that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for a cleaner environment .",0
16581,"Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier .",1
16582,"However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it .",0
16583,"In certain cases , however , competition can discourage new technology , especially when other firms can quickly copy a new idea .",0
16584,Consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug .,0
16585,"However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits .",0
16586,"The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .",1
16587,"As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year .",1
16588,"Data in [ link ] , from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers , Third Quarter 2014 , demonstrate that median weekly earnings are higher for workers who have completed more education .",0
16589,"While these rates of return will beat equivalent investments in Treasury bonds or savings accounts , the estimated returns to education go primarily to the individual worker , so these returns are private rates of return to education .",0
16590,"The first row is a header row and it labels the last three columns , ' Less than a High School Degree , ' ' High School Degree , No College , ' and ' Bachelor 's Degree . '",0
16591,One way to increase new technology is to guarantee the innovator an exclusive right to that new product or process .,0
16592,"Intellectual property rights include patents , which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time , and copyright laws , which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature , music , film / video , and pictures .",1
16593,"For example , if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty - one years , unless the firm with the patent grants permission .",0
16594,"For example , United for Medical Research , a coalition of groups that seek funding for the National Institutes of Health , ( which is supported by federal grants ) , states : “ NIH - supported research added $ 69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million jobs in 2011 alone . ” The United States remains the leading sponsor of medical - related research spending $ 117 billion in 2011 .",1
16595,"Other institutions , such as the National Academy of Scientists and the National Academy of Engineers , receive federal grants for innovative projects .",0
16596,"The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative ( AFRI ) at the United States Department of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems , from food safety to childhood obesity .",0
16597,"Instead , public goods have two defining characteristics : they are nonexcludable and nonrivalrous .",0
16598,"The first characteristic , that a public good is nonexcludable , means that it is costly or impossible to exclude someone from using the good .",1
16599,"Even when their climate and land are well - suited to products like cotton , rice , sugar , or milk , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to compete .",0
16600,Farm subsidies in the high - income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce .,0
16601,This increase in supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of production .,0
16602,"One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high - skilled , high - wage workers in the United States , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers .",0
16603,"After all , high - skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers , machinery , and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage .",0
16604,"However , Bhutanese politicians , business leaders , and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established , before it needed to face international competition , then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills , management , technology , and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit - earning domestic industry .",0
16605,"Thus , the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time , to give the infant industry time to mature , before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy .",1
16606,( Revisit Macroeconomic Policy Around the World for more information on the infant industry argument .,0
16607,Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production .,1
16608,"Since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO .",0
16609,"Anti - dumping complaints have risen in recent years , from about 100 cases per year in the late 1980s to about 200 new cases each year by the late 2000s .",0
16610,"In general , high - income countries such as the United States , Canada , Japan , and the nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards .",0
16611,"In contrast , middle- and low - income countries like Brazil , Nigeria , India , and China have lower environmental standards .",0
16612,"The general view of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a luxury : as soon as their people have enough to eat , decent healthcare , and longer life expectancies , then they will spend more money on sewage treatment plants , scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks , national parks to protect wildlife , and so on .",0
16613,"The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) was officially born in 1995 , but its history is much longer .",0
16614,"In the years after the Great Depression and World War II , there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations of the world together .",0
16615,The best known of these regional trading agreements is the European Union .,0
16616,"In the years after World War II , leaders of several European nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely , they might be more likely to avoid another devastating war .",0
16617,"In other words , the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or does not pose tradeoffs ; indeed , the story of Technotron begins with a particular disruptive market change — a new technology — that causes real tradeoffs .",0
16618,"In thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade , or any of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter , the best public policy solutions typically do not involve protectionism , but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the particular issues , while still allowing the benefits of international trade to occur .",0
16619,The m term in the equation for the line is the slope .,0
16620,"Remember that slope is defined as rise over run ; more specifically , the slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis .",0
16621,"In this example , each time the x term increases by one ( the run ) , the y term rises by three .",0
16622,"One common line graph is called a time series , in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable .",1
16623,"Thus , a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time .",0
16624,Economists use a vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people ’s preferences .,0
16625,"In Consumer Choices , the level of utility that a person receives is described in numerical terms .",0
16626,"This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences , called indifference curves , which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility .",0
16627,"Thus , the marginal utility that Lilly would gain from , say , increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84—so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B .",0
16628,"Indeed , the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution , which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same .",1
16629,Indifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right .,0
16630,A rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right .,0
16631,"In graphical terms , the new budget constraint will now be tangent to a higher indifference curve , representing a higher level of utility .",0
16632,"A reduction in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left , which will cause it to be tangent to a lower indifference curve , representing a reduced level of utility .",0
16633,The price of haircuts rises to $ 30 .,0
16634,Ogden starts at choice A on the higher opportunity set and the higher indifference curve .,0
16635,"After the price of pizza increases , he chooses B on the lower opportunity set and the lower indifference curve .",0
16636,The price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the firm .,0
16637,"The concept of a present discounted value ( PDV ) , which is defined as the amount you should be willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments , can be used to calculate appropriate prices for stocks and bonds .",1
16638,"To place a present discounted value on a future payment , think about what amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future .",0
16639,The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion .,0
16640,The first is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP .,0
16641,"Potential GDP means the same thing here that it means in the AD / AS diagrams : it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital . The second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line , which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right .",1
16642,"[ link ] shows an investment function where the level of investment is , for the sake of concreteness , set at the specific level of 500 .",0
16643,"Just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP ( or national income ) , the investment function shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP .",0
16644,"Imports are 0.1 of real GDP in this example , and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column .",0
16645,"The final column , aggregate expenditures , sums up C + I + G + X – M. This aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in [ link ] .",0
16646,"In this situation , the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level , and unemployment will occur .",0
16647,The distance between an output level like E0 that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a recessionary gap .,0
16648,"Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low , firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers , and unemployment will be high .",0
16649,The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency .,0
16650,One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another .,1
16651,"Remember , the demand curve traces consumers’ willingness to pay for different quantities .",0
16652,"The amount that individuals would have been willing to pay , minus the amount that they actually paid , is called consumer surplus .",1
16653,"Consumer surplus is the area labeled F — that is , the area above the market price and below the demand curve . Consumer and Producer Surplus The somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of consumer surplus , which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to pay .",0
16654,"First , an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced .",0
16655,The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called deadweight loss .,1
16656,"In a very real sense , it is like money thrown away that benefits no one .",0
16657,"The demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply , but by the interaction between the two .",0
