0,[ link ] shows a way of graphing the exchange of a virtual photon between two positive charges .,0
1,"This graph of time versus position is called a Feynman diagram , after the brilliant American physicist Richard Feynman ( 1918–1988 ) who developed it .",1
2,[ link ] is a Feynman diagram for the exchange of a virtual pion between a proton and a neutron representing the same interaction as in [ link ] .,0
3,"Feynman diagrams are not only a useful tool for visualizing interactions at the quantum mechanical level , they are also used to calculate details of interactions , such as their strengths and probability of occurring .",0
4,Special names are given to particles that feel the strong and weak nuclear forces .,0
5,"Hadrons are particles that feel the strong nuclear force , whereas leptons are particles that do not .",1
6,"The proton , neutron , and the pions are examples of hadrons .",0
7,"Mesons are hadrons that can decay to leptons and leave no hadrons , which implies that mesons are not conserved in number .",1
8,Baryons are hadrons that always decay to another baryon .,1
9,A new physical quantity called baryon number BB size 12{B } { } seems to always be conserved in nature and is listed for the various particles in the table given above .,0
10,"Keep in mind that all leptons seem to be fundamental , whereasno hadrons are fundamental .",0
11,There is strong evidence that quarks are the fundamental building blocks of hadrons as seen in [ link ] .,1
12,Quarks are the second group of fundamental particles ( leptons are the first ) .,0
13,"When a combination of quarks has color other than white , it exerts extremely large forces — even larger than the strong force — and perhaps can not be stable or permanently separated .",0
14,"This is part of the theory of quark confinement , which explains how quarks can exist and yet never be isolated or directly observed .",1
15,"Finally , an extra quantum number with three values ( like those we assign to color ) is necessary for quarks to obey the Pauli exclusion principle .",0
16,"Frontiers of Physics expands the story in making a connection with cosmology , on the opposite end of the distance scale .",0
17,"[ link ] is a Feynman diagram showing how the weak nuclear force is transmitted by the carrier particle Z0Z0 size 12{Z rSup { size 8{0 } } } { } , similar to the diagrams in [ link ] and [ link ] for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces .",0
18,"In the 1960s , a gauge theory , called electroweak theory , was developed by Steven Weinberg , Sheldon Glashow , and Abdus Salam and proposed that the electromagnetic and weak forces are identical at sufficiently high energies .",1
19,"One of its predictions , in addition to describing both electromagnetic and weak force phenomena , was the existence of the W+,W−W+,W− , and Z0Z0 carrier particles .",0
20,"In fact , there is enough energy when things are pushed to even smaller distances to transform the , and Z0Z0 size 12{Z rSup { size 8{0 } } } { } into massless carrier particles more similar to photons and gluons .",0
21,"These have not been observed experimentally , but there is a prediction of an associated particle called the Higgs boson .",0
22,"The mass of this particle is not predicted with nearly the certainty with which the mass of the W+,W−,W+,W− , and Z0Z0 size 12{Z rSup { size 8{0 } } } { } particles were predicted , but it was hoped that the Higgs boson could be observed at the now - canceled Superconducting Super Collider ( SSC ) .",0
23,Perhaps the most important characteristic of the universe is that all galaxies except those in our local cluster seem to be moving away from us at speeds proportional to their distance from our galaxy .,0
24,"It looks as if a gigantic explosion , universally called the Big Bang , threw matter out some billions of years ago .",1
25,"This amazing conclusion is based on the pioneering work of Edwin Hubble ( 1889–1953 ) , the American astronomer .",0
26,"At 10−43s10−43s size 12{""""10 """" rSup { size 8 { - """" 43 """" } } ` s } { } , the average energy reaches the immense 1019GeV1019GeV size 12{""""10 """" rSup { size 8{""""19 """" } } ` """" GeV """" } { } needed to unify gravity with the other forces in TOE , the Theory of Everything .",0
27,"Before that time is the TOE epoch , but we have almost no idea as to the nature of the universe then , since we have no workable theory of quantum gravity .",0
28,We call the hypothetical unified force superforce . Now let us imagine starting at TOE and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way .,1
29,"We know from Special Relativity that relativity is the study of how different observers measure the same event , particularly if they move relative to one another .",1
30,Einstein ’s theory of general relativity describes all types of relative motion including accelerated motion and the effects of gravity .,1
31,General relativity encompasses special relativity and classical relativity in situations where acceleration is zero and relative velocity is small compared with the speed of light .,1
32,"Black holesBlack holes are objects having such large gravitational fields that things can fall in , but nothing , not even light , can escape .",1
33,"Bodies , like the Earth or the Sun , have what is called an escape velocity .",0
34,"These objects were first discovered in 1967 by the British astrophysicists , Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish .",0
35,Neutron stars are literally a star composed of neutrons .,1
36,"They are formed by the collapse of a star ’s core in a supernova , during which electrons and protons are forced together to form neutrons ( the reverse of neutron ββ size 12{β } { } decay ) .",0
37,"Introduced earlier in GUTS : The Unification of Forces Superstring theory is an attempt to unify gravity with the other three forces and , thus , must contain quantum gravity .",1
38,"The main tenet of Superstring theory is that fundamental particles , including the graviton that carries the gravitational force , act like one - dimensional vibrating strings .",0
39,"Finally , the most recent measurements of the CMBR have implications for the cosmological constant , so it is not simply a device concocted for a single purpose . After the recent experimental discovery of the cosmological constant , most researchers feel that the universe should be just barely open .",0
40,"Since matter can be thought to curve the space around it , we call an open universe negatively curved .",0
41,This means that you can in principle travel an unlimited distance in any direction .,1
42,The question is open as to how many planets or other bodies smaller than about 1/1000 the mass of the Sun are there .,0
43,"If such bodies pass between us and a star , they will not block the star ’s light , being too small , but they will form a gravitational lens , as discussed in General Relativity and Quantum Gravity . In a process called microlensing , light from the star is focused and the star appears to brighten in a characteristic manner .",1
44,Searches for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in galactic halos because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there .,0
45,The most radical proposal to explain dark matter is that it consists of previously unknown leptons ( sometimes obtusely referred to as non - baryonic matter ) .,0
46,"These are called weakly interacting massive particles , or WIMPs , and would also be chargeless , thus interacting negligibly with normal matter , except through gravitation .",1
47,One proposed group of WIMPs would have masses several orders of magnitude greater than nucleons and are sometimes called neutralinos .,1
48,It is also based partly in physics and treats broad classes of phenomena from many disciplines .,0
49,Chaos is a word used to describe systems whose outcomes are extremely sensitive to initial conditions .,1
50,"The orbit of the planet Pluto , for example , may be chaotic in that it can change tremendously due to small interactions with other planets .",0
51,"For example , if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell , you will hear the bell ’s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by .",0
52,The actual change in frequency due to relative motion of source and observer is called a Doppler shift .,1
53,"The Doppler effect and Doppler shift are named for the Austrian physicist and mathematician Christian Johann Doppler ( 1803–1853 ) , who did experiments with both moving sources and moving observers .",0
54,Power is associated by many people with electricity .,0
55,"Knowing that power is the rate of energy use or energy conversion , what is the expression for electric power ?",1
56,Power transmission lines might come to mind .,0
57,Lawrence was involved in many early discoveries and in the promotion of physics programs in American universities .,0
58,"He was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics for the cyclotron and nuclear activations , and he has an element and two major laboratories named for him . A synchrotron is a version of a cyclotron in which the frequency of the alternating voltage and the magnetic field strength are increased as the beam particles are accelerated .",1
59,Particles are made to travel the same distance in a shorter time with each cycle in fixed - radius orbits .,0
60,"Its cost as well as the politics of international research funding led to its demise . In addition to the large synchrotrons that produce colliding beams of protons and antiprotons , there are other large electron - positron accelerators .",0
61,"The oldest of these was a straight - line or linear accelerator , called the Stanford Linear Accelerator ( SLAC ) , which accelerated particles up to 50 GeV as seen in [ link ] .",1
62,"The pion must then be captured and , thus , can not be directly observed because that would amount to a permanent violation of mass - energy conservation .",0
63,"Such particles ( like the pion above ) are called virtual particles , because they can not be directly observed but their effects can be directly observed .",1
64,"Realizing all this , Yukawa used the information on the range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion , the particle that carries it .",0
65,"He shared the 1965 Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and S. I. Tomonaga for work in QED with its deep implications for particle physics . Why is it that particles called gluons are listed as the carrier particles for the strong nuclear force when , in The Yukawa Particle and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle Revisited , we saw that pions apparently carry that force ?",0
66,"The answer is that pions are exchanged but they have a substructure and , as we explore it , we find that the strong force is actually related to the indirectly observed but more fundamental gluons .",0
67,"In fact , all the carrier particles are thought to be fundamental in the sense that they have no substructure .",0
68,Quarks have been mentioned at various points in this text as fundamental building blocks and members of the exclusive club of truly elementary particles .,0
69,Note that an elementary or fundamental particle has no substructure ( it is not made of other particles ) and has no finite size other than its wavelength .,1
70,"This does not mean that fundamental particles are stable — some decay , while others do not .",0
71,"Originally , three quark types — or flavors — were proposed to account for the then - known mesons and baryons .",0
72,"These quark flavors are named up ( u ) , down ( d ) , and strange ( s ) .",0
73,All quarks have half - integral spin and are thus fermions .,0
74,"The analogy to the unification of electric and magnetic forces is quite good — the four forces are distinct under normal circumstances , but there are hints of connections even on the atomic scale , and there may be conditions under which the forces are intimately related and even indistinguishable .",0
75,"The search for a correct theory linking the forces , called the Grand Unified Theory ( GUT ) , is explored in this section in the realm of particle physics .",0
76,"Frontiers of Physics expands the story in making a connection with cosmology , on the opposite end of the distance scale .",0
77,"[ link ] is a Feynman diagram showing how the weak nuclear force is transmitted by the carrier particle Z0Z0 size 12{Z rSup { size 8{0 } } } { } , similar to the diagrams in [ link ] and [ link ] for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces .",0
78,"It is beyond the scope of this text to go into more detail on the types of quark and gluon interactions that underlie the observable particles , but the theory ( quantum chromodynamics or QCD ) is very self - consistent .",0
79,"So successful have QCD and the electroweak theory been that , taken together , they are called the Standard Model .",0
80,"Advances in knowledge are expected to modify , but not overthrow , the Standard Model of particle physics and forces .",0
81,And the nature of the universe has implications for unexplored regions of particle physics .,0
82,Cosmology is the study of the character and evolution of the universe .,1
83,What are the major characteristics of the universe as we know them today ?,0
84,""""" 002""""`K } { } .",0
85,The detection of what is now called the cosmic microwave background ( CMBR ) was so important ( generally considered as important as Hubble ’s detection that the galactic red shift is proportional to distance ) that virtually every scientist has accepted the expansion of the universe as fact .,0
86,Penzias and Wilson shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery .,0
87,"By 1916 , he had laid the foundation of general relativity , again almost on his own .",0
88,Much of what Einstein did to develop his ideas was to mentally analyze certain carefully and clearly defined situations — doing this is to perform a thought experiment .,1
89,[ link ] illustrates a thought experiment like the ones that convinced Einstein that light must fall in a gravitational field .,0
90,"Gravitational wavesIf a massive object distorts the space around it , like the foot of a water bug on the surface of a pond , then movement of the massive object should create waves in space like those on a pond .",0
91,Gravitational waves are mass - created distortions in space that propagate at the speed of light and are predicted by general relativity .,1
92,"Since gravity is by far the weakest force , extreme conditions are needed to generate significant gravitational waves .",0
93,"This , until recently , was a question of whether there is enough gravitation to stop the expansion of the universe .",0
94,"In the past few years , it has become a question of the combination of gravitation and what is called the cosmological constant .",0
95,The cosmological constant was invented by Einstein to prohibit the expansion or contraction of the universe .,0
96,"At the time he developed general relativity , Einstein considered that an illogical possibility .",0
97,"This means that if you travel far enough in any direction , you will return to your starting point , analogous to circumnavigating the Earth .",0
98,In between these two is a flat ( zero curvature ) universe .,0
99,"The recent discovery of the cosmological constant has shown the universe is very close to flat , and will expand forever .",0
100,"The simple laws of physics apply , of course , but complex systems may reveal patterns that simple systems do not .",0
101,"The emerging field of complexity is devoted to the study of complex systems , including those outside the traditional bounds of physics .",1
102,Of particular interest is the ability of complex systems to adapt and evolve .,0
103,The characteristic sound of a motorcycle buzzing by is an example of the Doppler effect .,0
104,The high - pitch scream shifts dramatically to a lower - pitch roar as the motorcycle passes by a stationary observer .,0
105,Sonic booms are one example of a broader phenomenon called bow wakes .,0
106,"A bow wake , such as the one in [ link ] , is created when the wave source moves faster than the wave propagation speed .",1
107,"Water waves spread out in circles from the point where created , and the bow wake is the familiar V - shaped wake trailing the source .",0
108,"Energies produced by Van de Graaffs are insufficient to produce new particles , but they have been instrumental in exploring several aspects of the nucleus .",0
109,"Another , equally famous , early accelerator is the cyclotron , invented in 1930 by the American physicist , E. O. Lawrence ( 1901–1958 ) .",0
110,"For a visual representation with more detail , see [ link ] .",0
111,One solution to this problem is to have head - on collisions between particles moving in opposite directions .,0
112,Colliding beams are made to meet head - on at points where massive detectors are located .,0
113,Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues : economic inequality and poverty .,0
114,Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .,1
115,"In the United States , the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person : Mollie Orshansky .",0
116,"In 1963 , Orshansky , who was working for the Social Security Administration , published an article called “ Children of the Poor ” in a highly useful and dry - as - dust publication called the Social Security Bulletin .",0
117,"As a result , the person experiences no net gain for working .",0
118,Economists call this problem the poverty trap .,0
119,"The U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line , who are referred to as the near - poor .",1
120,"Such programs are called the safety net , in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income .",0
121,"From the Great Depression of the 1930s until 1996 , the United States’ most visible antipoverty program was Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) , which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line .",1
122,"This program was often just called “ welfare . ” In 1996 , Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act , more commonly called the “ welfare reform act . ” The new law replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) .",0
123,"Often called “ food stamps , ” Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) is a federally funded program , started in 1964 , in which each month poor people receive a card like a debit card that they can use to buy food .",1
124,"The amount of food aid for which a household is eligible varies by income , number of children , and other factors but , in general , households are expected to spend about 30 % of their own net income on food , and if 30 % of their net income is not enough to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet , then those households are eligible for SNAP.SNAP can contribute to the poverty trap .",0
125,Medicaid was created by Congress in 1965 and is a joint health insurance program entered into by both the states and the federal government .,1
126,"The federal government helps fund Medicaid , but each state is responsible for administering the program , determining the level of benefits , and determining eligibility .",0
127,"For example , you could draw a bar graph that showed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution .",0
128,[ link ] presents an alternative way of showing inequality data in what is called a Lorenz curve .,0
129,The Lorenz curve shows the cumulative share of population on the horizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis .,1
130,"Public policy can attempt to build a ladder of opportunities so that , even though all children will never come from identical families and attend identical schools , each child has a reasonable opportunity to attain an economic niche in society based on their interests , desires , talents , and efforts .",0
131,Some of those initiatives include those shown in [ link ] .,0
132,"A labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively , rather than as individuals .",1
133,"Thus , negotiations between unions and firms are sometimes called collective bargaining . The subject of labor unions can be controversial .",1
134,Supporters of labor unions view them as the workers’ primary line of defense against efforts by profit - seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits .,0
135,"Two key issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners for record - keeping and computer - operated cabs for loading and unloading ships — changes which the union opposed , along with overtime pay .",0
136,President Obama threatened to use the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947—commonly known as the Taft - Hartley Act — where a court can impose an 80-day “ cooling - off period ” in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a work stoppage .,1
137,"Federal mediators were called in , and the two sides agreed to a deal in February 2015 .",0
138,The close connection between union membership and a friendly legal environment is apparent in the history of U.S. unions .,0
139,"The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage of the National Labor - Management Relations Act of 1935 , which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and that management had to give them a fair chance to do so .",1
140,The U.S. government strongly encouraged the formation of unions during the early 1940s in the belief that unions would help to coordinate the all - out production efforts needed during World War II .,0
141,Investigating the Black / White Earnings GapBlacks experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much of the twentieth century .,0
142,"Until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a black worker , regardless of the credentials or experience of that worker .",0
143,"Moreover , blacks were often denied access to educational opportunities , which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for many jobs .",0
144,"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .",1
145,The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are 40 years of age or older .,1
146,The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination .,1
147,"Today , affirmative action policies are applied only to federal contractors who have lost a discrimination lawsuit .",0
148,This type of redress is enforced by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) .,0
149,"In August 2009 , many members of the U.S. Congress used their summer recess to return to their home districts and hold town hall - style meetings to discuss President Obama ’s proposed changes to the U.S. healthcare system .",1
150,"This was officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) or as the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , but was more popularly known as Obamacare .",0
151,"The bill ’s opponents’ claims ranged from the charge that the changes were unconstitutional and would add $ 750 billion to the deficit , to extreme claims about the inclusion of things like the implantation of microchips and so - called “ death panels ” that decide which critically - ill patients receive care and which do not .",0
152,"Also , the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information , in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction .",1
153,"Let ’s begin with some examples of how imperfect information complicates transactions in goods , labor , and financial capital markets .",0
154,The presence of imperfect information can easily cause a decline in prices or quantities of products sold .,0
155,A market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market .,1
156,"By contrast , a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market .",1
157,"When imperfect information is severe and buyers and sellers are discouraged from participating , markets may become extremely thin as a relatively small number of buyer and sellers attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price .",0
158,"“ If only you knew more economics , you would not be so irrational , ” is what many mainstream economists seem to be saying .",0
159,"A group known as behavioral economists has challenged this notion , because so much of this so - called “ quirky ” behavior is extremely common among us .",0
160,"For example , a conventional economist would say that if you lost a $ 10 bill today , and also got an extra $ 10 in your paycheck , you should feel perfectly neutral .",0
161,"Sellers may offer a warranty , which is a promise to fix or replace the good , at least for a certain period of time .",1
162,"The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period .",1
163,"Service contracts are often used with large purchases such as cars , appliances and even houses .",0
164,"In the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank conducts a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing .",0
165,"Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .",1
166,Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect .,1
167,"Generally , households or firms with insurance make regular payments , called premiums .",1
168,"Unemployment insurance : Employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance , which goes into a fund that is used to pay benefits to workers for a period of time , usually six months , after they lose their jobs .",1
169,"Workman ’s compensation insurance : Employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the salaries that they pay into funds , typically run at the state level , that are used to pay benefits to workers who suffer an injury on the job .",1
170,Moral hazard refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they did not have insurance .,1
171,"For example , if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor , you may be less likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor ’s visit .",0
172,"Health insurance policies often have a copayment , in which the policyholder must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ 20 for each doctor visit , and the insurance company would cover the rest .",1
173,"Another method of cost - sharing is coinsurance , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost .",1
174,"For example , insurance might pay for 80 % of the costs of repairing a home after a fire , but the homeowner would pay the other 20 % .",0
175,Adverse selection refers to the problem in which the buyers of insurance have more information about whether they are high - risk or low - risk than the insurance company does .,1
176,"This creates an asymmetric information problem for the insurance company because buyers who are high - risk tend to want to buy more insurance , without letting the insurance company know about their higher risk .",0
177,"In March of 2010 , President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) .",0
178,This highly contentious law began to be phased in over time starting in October of 2013 .,0
179,"Individuals can not , however , take the few thousand dollars that they save in any given year , write a letter to General Motors or some other firm , and negotiate to invest their money with that firm .",0
180,"Financial capital markets bridge this gap : that is , they find ways to take the inflow of funds from many separate suppliers of financial capital and transform it into the funds desired by demanders of financial capital .",1
181,"Such financial markets include stocks , bonds , bank loans , and other financial investments .",0
182,"They also provide advice on potential products , customers , and key employees .",0
183,"Typically , a venture capital fund invests in a number of firms , and then investors in that fund receive returns according to how the fund as a whole performs . The amount of money invested in venture capital fluctuates substantially from year to year : as one example , venture capital firms invested more than $ 48.3 billion in 2014 , according to the National Venture Capital Association .",1
184,"All early - stage investors realize that the majority of small startup businesses will never hit it big ; indeed , many of them will go out of business within a few months or years .",0
185,"A corporate bond is issued by firms , but bonds are also issued by various levels of government .",1
186,"For example , a municipal bond is issued by cities , a state bond by U.S. states , and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury .",1
187,"Those who buy the stock become the owners , or shareholders , of the firm .",0
188,"Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .",1
189,"First , a firm receives money from the sale of its stock only when the company sells its own stock to the public ( the public includes individuals , mutual funds , insurance companies , and pension funds ) .",0
190,A firm ’s first sale of stock to the public is called an initial public offering ( IPO ) .,1
191,The IPO is important for two reasons .,0
192,A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day - to - day basis .,1
193,"A private company can be run by individuals , in which case it is called a sole proprietorship , or it can be run by a group , in which case it is a partnership .",1
194,"Accurate information is sometimes not available because corporate governance , the name economists give to the institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives , fails , as the following Clear It Up feature on Lehman Brothers shows . How did lack of corporate governance lead to the Lehman Brothers failure ?",1
195,"It is usually the average return over a period of time , usually in years or even decades .",0
196,Risk measures the uncertainty of that project ’s profitability .,1
197,"There are several types of risk , including default risk and interest rate risk .",0
198,Banks offer a range of accounts to serve different needs .,0
199,"A checking account typically pays little or no interest , but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a debit card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company ) .",1
200,"A savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine ( or you can access the funds electronically ) .",1
201,"In part , this safety arises because a bank account offers more security than keeping a few thousand dollars in the toe of a sock in your underwear drawer .",0
202,"In addition , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) protects the savings of the average person .",1
203,"Every bank is required by law to pay a fee to the FDIC , based on the size of its deposits .",0
204,This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity .,0
205,"The bond has a coupon rate or interest rate , which is usually semi - annual , but can be paid at different times throughout the year .",0
206,( Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest . ),0
207,The bond yield measures the rate of return a bond is expected to pay over time .,1
208,Bonds are bought not only when they are issued ; they are also bought and sold during their lifetimes .,0
209,An individual firm may find itself buffeted by unfavorable supply and demand conditions or hurt by unlucky or unwise managerial decisions .,0
210,"Thus , a standard recommendation from financial investors is diversification , which means buying stocks or bonds from a wide range of companies .",1
211,"A saver who diversifies is following the old proverb : “ Do n’t put all your eggs in one basket . ” In any broad group of companies , some firms will do better than expected and some will do worse — but the extremes have a tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in value .",0
212,About two - thirds of U.S. households own their own home .,0
213,An owner ’s equity in a house is the monetary value the owner would have after selling the house and repaying any outstanding bank loans used to buy the house .,0
214,"For example , imagine that you buy a house for $ 200,000 , paying 10 % of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank loan for the remaining $ 180,000 .",0
215,Compound interest is an interest rate calculation on the principal plus the accumulated interest .,1
216,"In 2002 , Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( BCRA ) .",0
217,The relatively noncontroversial portions of the act strengthen the rules requiring full and speedy disclosure of who contributes money to campaigns .,0
218,"As this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust Policy ) .",0
219,"In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma .",0
220,"The political pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently quite high , while the political pressure to assist the 40 million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower .",0
221,"One reason might be that senior citizens are represented by AARP , a well - funded and well - organized lobbying group , while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without health insurance .",0
222,"For example , policies that impose price controls — like rent control — may look as if they benefit renters and impose costs only on landlords .",0
223,"However , when landlords then decide to reduce the number of rental units available in the area , a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere else because no units were available .",0
224,"Democracy is sometimes summed up ( and oversimplified ) in two words : “ Majority rule . ” When voters face three or more choices , however , then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority prefers .",1
225,"The situation in which Choice A is preferred by a majority over Choice B , Choice B is preferred by a majority over Choice C , and Choice C is preferred by a majority over Choice A is called a voting cycle .",1
226,"It is easy to imagine sets of government choices — say , perhaps the choice between increased defense spending , increased government spending on health care , and a tax cut — in which a voting cycle could occur .",0
227,"In April 2009 , the union representing U.S. tire manufacturing workers filed a request with the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) , asking it to investigate tire imports from China .",0
228,"Under U.S. trade law , if imports from a country increase to the point that they cause market disruption in the United States , as determined by the ITC , then it can also recommend a remedy for this market disruption .",0
229,Who buys all of this production ?,0
230,"This demand can be divided into four main parts : consumer spending ( consumption ) , business spending ( investment ) , government spending on goods and services , and spending on net exports .",1
231,( See the following Clear It Up feature to understand what is meant by investment . ),0
232,"The net export component of GDP is equal to the dollar value of exports ( X ) minus the dollar value of imports ( M ) , ( X – M ) .",1
233,The gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance .,1
234,"If a country ’s exports are larger than its imports , then a country is said to have a trade surplus .",1
235,"Indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s .",0
236,"[ link ] ( b ) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades , even after the declines during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009 .",0
237,"As noted before , if exports and imports are equal , foreign trade has no effect on total GDP .",0
238,"To avoid this problem , which would overstate the size of the economy considerably , government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption , investment , government , and trade purposes .",0
239,"Intermediate goods , which are goods that go into the production of other goods , are excluded from GDP calculations .",1
240,"Net national product ( NNP ) is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year .",1
241,The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .,1
242,"Similarly , if you do not know the rate of inflation , it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced .",0
243,The nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time .,1
244,The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation .,1
245,[ link ] shows the U.S. nominal and real GDP since 1960 .,0
246,"Because 2005 is the base year , the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year .",0
247,A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession .,1
248,An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .,1
249,"The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure , as is the Great Recession of 2008–2009 .",0
250,"Thus , a recession lasts from peak to trough , and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak .",0
251,The movement of the economy from peak to trough and trough to peak is called the business cycle .,1
252,It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough - to - peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since 1960 .,0
253,"Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A ’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B ’s currency ( for example , Japanese yen per British pound ) , or as the inverse ( for example , British pounds per Japanese yen ) .",1
254,"Two types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose , market exchange rates and purchasing power parity ( PPP ) equivalent exchange rates .",0
255,Market exchange rates vary on a day - to - day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets .,1
256,"One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent decades is that , as of 1970 , only about 42 % of women participated in the paid labor force .",0
257,"By the second decade of the 2000s , nearly 60 % of women participated in the paid labor force according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .",0
258,"As women are now in the labor force , many of the services they used to produce in the non - market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy , which makes the GDP appear larger even if more services are not actually being consumed .",0
259,"Before the last two centuries , although rulers , nobles , and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level , the average person ’s standard of living had not changed much for centuries . Progressive , powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries .",0
260,"According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden , slavery - based societies , favorable demographics , global trading routes , and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed .",0
261,The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power - driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s .,1
262,Economic growth depends on many factors .,0
263,Key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and protection of property rights and contractual rights by a country ’s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently .,0
264,"Laws must be clear , public , fair , enforced , and equally applicable to all members of society .",0
265,The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change .,0
266,"Technological change is a combination of invention — advances in knowledge — and innovation , which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service .",1
267,"For example , the transistor was invented in 1947 .",0
268,"While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 ( around 3 % ) , it has slowed down since then .",0
269,Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages .,0
270,"Over time , the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce .",0
271,The category of technology is the “ joker in the deck . ” Earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation .,0
272,"When most people think of new technology , the invention of new products like the laser , the smartphone , or some new wonder drug come to mind .",0
273,"When society increases the level of capital per person , the result is called capital deepening .",1
274,The idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker .,0
275,"Some low - income and middle - income economies around the world have shown a pattern of convergence , in which their economies grow faster than those of high - income countries .",0
276,"GDP increased by an average rate of 2.7 % per year in the 1990s and 2.3 % per year from 2000 to 2008 in the high - income countries of the world , which include the United States , Canada , the countries of the European Union , Japan , Australia , and New Zealand .",0
277,How did these incomes increase ?,0
278,The neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital .,1
279,Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence .,0
280,"There are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs and who are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as employed , though they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be .",0
281,"Additionally , there are individuals who are underemployed .",0
282,This includes those that are trained or skilled for one type or level of work who are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills .,0
283,There does not seem to be a long - term trend toward the rate moving generally higher or generally lower .,0

285,One primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro economy .,0
286,"If firms believe that business is expanding , then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater quantity of labor , and the labor demand curve shifts to the right .",0
287,"In other words , these people are involuntarily unemployed .",0
288,What causes involuntary unemployment ?,0
289,"One argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract , which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble , and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong .",0
290,"This wage - setting behavior acts like a form of insurance : the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times , but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times .",0
291,"The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ” A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on .",1
292,"However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects . Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan .",1
293,"In a market economy , some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons : old technology ; poor management ; good management that happened to make bad decisions ; shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm ’s product is desired ; a large customer who went broke ; or tough domestic or foreign competitors .",0
294,"Conversely , other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees .",0
295,"However , adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly .",0
296,Wages are typically reviewed only once or twice a year .,0
297,"In many modern jobs , it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level .",0
298,"Sure , the average worker in 2014 is better educated and more productive than the average worker in 1970—but not six times more productive .",0
299,"Sure , per capita GDP increased substantially from 1970 to 2014 , but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than eight times better off in just 44 years ?",0
300,Not likely . A modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand .,0
301,"To simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods , the price level in each period is typically reported as an index number , rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods .",0
302,Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time .,1
303,The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four .,0
304,"In recent years , the statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem : that the change in the total cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of living , because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility .",0
305,"As we ’ve learned , CPI measures prices as they affect everyday household spending .",1
306,"Well , a core inflation index is typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables .",1
307,"In this way , economists have a better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living .",0
308,There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported .,1
309,An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .,1
310,"The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) .",1
311,"Times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower , as in the recession of 1920–1921 , the Great Depression , the recession of 1980–1982 , and the Great Recession in 2008–2009 .",0
312,"There were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary , but not at an annual rate .",0
313,"What are the economic problems caused by inflation , and why do economists often regard them with less concern than the general public ?",0
314,Consider a very short story : “ The Land of Funny Money . ”,0
315,The problem of a good - looking nominal interest rate being transformed into an ugly - looking real interest rate can be worsened by taxes .,0
316,"The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms , without an adjustment for inflation .",0
317,The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles .,0
318,"These plans are tax deferred , and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer , their 401(k ) comes with them .",0
319,"To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return , retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners . However , ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation .",0
320,Inflation can make long - term planning difficult .,0
321,"In discussing unintended redistributions , we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation .",0
322,"Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement , because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when the rate of future inflation can not be known with certainty .",0
323,An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation .,1
324,A wide array of indexing arrangements is observed in private markets and government programs .,0
325,"Since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another — say , increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive — indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation .",0
326,The Social Security program offers two examples of indexing .,0
327,"Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing Act of 1972 , the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index .",0
328,"Also , Social Security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount—$117,000 in 2014 .",1
329,"The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase .",1
330,"Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .",1
331,"If imports exceed exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit .",1
332,"A few decades ago , it was common to track the solid or physical items that were transported by planes , trains , and trucks between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade .",1
333,This measurement is called the merchandise trade balance .,0
334,"In most high - income economies , including the United States , goods make up less than half of a country ’s total production , while services compose more than half .",0
335,"Statistics on the balance of trade are compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) within the U.S. Department of Commerce , using a variety of different sources .",0
336,"The final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers , which are payments made by government , private charities , or individuals in which money is sent abroad without any direct good or service being received .",1
337,"Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into this category , as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities .",0
338,"The story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of comparative advantage , which you learn more about in the International Trade chapter .",0
339,The following Work It Out feature steps you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the United States and Great Britain in the 1800s . Calculating Comparative Advantage,0
340,The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance .,0
341,"In a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments .",0
342,"When the trade deficit rises , it necessarily means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital .",0
343,The national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways .,0
344,"A nation ’s level of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balance of trade , but these two are actually quite separate .",0
345,It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade — measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP — while it also has a near - balance between exports and imports .,0
346,A high level of trade indicates that a good portion of the nation ’s production is exported .,1
347,The next three chapters take up this task .,0
348,"This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand , how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium , and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium .",0
349,"This chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy ( growth , unemployment , and inflation ) , and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals .",1
350,"The bottom line remains , however , that every sale represents income to someone , and so , Say ’s law argues , a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy .",1
351,"Because Jean - Baptiste Say , Adam Smith , and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as “ classical ” economists , modern economists who generally subscribe to the Say ’s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists . If supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level , then ( as Say himself recognized ) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur .",1
352,"To be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses .",0
353,"The alternative to Say ’s law , with its emphasis on supply , can be named Keynes’ law : “ Demand creates its own supply . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , just as Jean - Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say ’s law , John Maynard Keynes never wrote down Keynes’ law , but the law is a useful simplification that conveys a certain point of view . When Keynes wrote his great work The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money during the Great Depression of the 1930s , he pointed out that during the Depression , the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services had not changed much .",1
354,"While we applaud the technology spillovers of NASA ’s space projects , we should also acknowledge that those benefits are not shared equally .",0
355,"Economists like Tyler Cowen , a professor at George Mason University , are seeing more and more evidence of a widening gap between those who have access to rapidly improving technology , and those who do not .",0
356,"According to Cowen author of the recent book , Average Is Over : Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation , this inequality in access to technology and information is going to deepen the inequality in skills , and ultimately , in wages and global standards of living .",0
357,Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living .,1
358,"Income inequality compares the share of the total income ( or wealth ) in society that is received by different groups ; for example , comparing the share of income received by the top 10 % to the share of income received by the bottom 10 % .",1
359,"After all , according to the Federal Register , the median household income for a family of four was $ 102,552 in New Jersey and $ 57,132 in Mississippi in 2013 , and prices of some basic goods like housing are quite different between states .",0
360,"The poverty line is based on cash income , which means it does not take into account government programs that provide assistance to the poor in a non - cash form , like Medicaid ( health care for low - income individuals and families ) and food aid .",1
361,"Also , low - income families can qualify for federal housing assistance .",0
362,"At the other extreme of the budget constraint line , an individual would work zero hours , earn zero income , but enjoy 2,500 hours of leisure .",0
363,"At point A on the budget constraint line , by working 40 hours a week , 50 weeks a year , the utility - maximizing choice is to work a total of 2,000 hours per year and earn $ 16,000.Now suppose that a government antipoverty program guarantees every family with a single mother and two children $ 18,000 in income .",0
364,"This is represented on the graph by a horizontal line at $ 18,000 .",0
365,"From the Great Depression of the 1930s until 1996 , the United States’ most visible antipoverty program was Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) , which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line .",1
366,"This program was often just called “ welfare . ” In 1996 , Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act , more commonly called the “ welfare reform act . ” The new law replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) .",0
367,"[ link ] illustrates that the earned income tax credits , child tax credits , and the TANF program all cost the federal government money — either in direct outlays or in loss of tax revenues .",0
368,"CTC stands for the government tax cuts for the child tax credit . Real Federal Spending on CTC , EITC , and TANF , 1975 - 2013EITC increased from more than $ 20 billion in 2000 to over an estimated $ 50 billion by 2013 , far exceeding estimated 2013 outlays in the CTC ( Child Tax Credits ) and TANF of over $ 20 billion and $ 10 billion , respectively .",0
369,( Source : Office of Management and Budget ),0
370,"The safety net includes a number of other programs : government - subsidized school lunches and breakfasts for children from low - income families ; the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) , which provides food assistance for pregnant women and newborns ; the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program , which provides help with home heating bills ; housing assistance , which helps pay the rent ; and Supplemental Security Income , which provides cash support for the disabled and the elderly poor .",1
371,"Income is a flow of money received , often measured on a monthly or an annual basis ; wealth is the sum of the value of all assets , including money in bank accounts , financial investments , a pension fund , and the value of a home .",1
372,"In calculating wealth all debts must be subtracted , such as debt owed on a home mortgage and on credit cards .",0
373,"Data from household income tax returns in 2009 shows that the top 1 % of households had an average income of $ 1,219,700 per year in pre - tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of 28.9 % .",0
374,"The effective income tax , which is total taxes paid divided by total income ( all sources of income such as wages , profits , interest , rental income , and government transfers such as veterans’ benefits ) , was much lower .",1
375,"The effective tax paid by the top 1 % of householders was 20.4 % , while the bottom two quintiles actually paid negative effective income taxes , because of provisions like the earned income tax credit .",0
376,"This labor market situation resembles what a monopoly firm does in selling a product , but in this case a union is a monopoly selling labor to firms .",0
377,"At the higher union wage Wu , the firms in this industry will hire less labor than they would have hired in equilibrium .",0
378,"Because over time unions were stronger in manufacturing than in service industries , the growth in jobs was not happening where the unions were .",0
379,"It is interesting to note that several of the biggest unions in the country are made up of government workers , including the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) ; the Service Employees International Union ; and the National Education Association .",1
380,The membership of each of these unions is listed in [ link ] .,0
381,A first public policy step against discrimination in the labor market is to make it illegal .,0
382,"For example , the Equal Pay Act of 1963 said that men and women who do equal work at a company must be paid the same .",1
383,"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .",1
384,"One disruptive effect , as just noted , is that immigration weighted toward low - skill workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low - skill workers .",0
385,"A study by Michael S. Clune found that for each 10 % rise in the number of employed immigrants with no more than a high school diploma in the labor market , high school students reduced their annual number of hours worked by 3 % .",0
386,The effects on wages of low - skill workers are not large — perhaps in the range of decline of about 1 % .,0
387,"Many economic transactions are made in a situation of imperfect information , where either the buyer , the seller , or both , are less than 100 % certain about the qualities of what is being bought and sold .",1
388,"Also , the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information , in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction .",1
389,A market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a thin market .,1
390,"By contrast , a market with many buyers and sellers is called a thick market .",1
391,"Sellers may offer a warranty , which is a promise to fix or replace the good , at least for a certain period of time .",1
392,"The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract , where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period .",1
393,"Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .",1
394,"Yet another approach is to require collateral , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid .",1
395,Federal and state governments run a number of insurance programs .,0
396,"Some of the programs look much like private insurance , in the sense that the members of a group makes steady payments into a fund , and those in the group who suffer an adverse experience receive payments .",0
397,"Other programs protect against risk , but without an explicit fund being set up .",0
398,"Deposit insurance : Banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which goes into a fund that is used to pay depositors the value of their bank deposits up to $ 250,000 ( the amount was raised from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 in 2008 ) if the bank should go bankrupt .",1
399,Some drivers are safer than others .,0
400,A risk group can be defined as a group that shares roughly the same risks of an adverse event occurring .,1
401,"For example , auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ 500 .",0
402,"Health insurance policies often have a copayment , in which the policyholder must pay a small amount ; for example , a person might have to pay $ 20 for each doctor visit , and the insurance company would cover the rest .",1
403,"Another method of cost - sharing is coinsurance , which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost .",1
404,"However , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) .",0
405,A health maintenance organization ( HMO ) provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the plan — regardless of how many services are provided .,1
406,"In this case , a patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care , but the healthcare provider , which is receiving only a fixed payment , has an incentive to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care provided — as long as it will not lead to worse health problems and higher costs later .",0
407,"The profit trend has since continued to increase each year , though at a less steady or consistent rate .",0
408,"( Source : Federal Reserve Economic Data ( FRED ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPATAX ) 2013 reports showed corporate profits after tax were around $ 1,800 billion .",0
409,"Venture capital firms make financial investments in new companies that are still relatively small in size , but that have potential to grow substantially .",1
410,"These firms gather money from a variety of individual or institutional investors , including banks , institutions like college endowments , insurance companies that hold financial reserves , and corporate pension funds .",0
411,A corporation is a business that “ incorporates ” — that is owned by shareholders that have limited liability for the debt of the company but share in its profits ( and losses ) .,1
412,"Corporations may be private or public , and may or may not have stock that is publicly traded .",0
413,"Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .",1
414,The stock of a company is divided into shares .,1
415,"Corporate giants like IBM , AT&T , Ford , General Electric , Microsoft , Merck , and Exxon all have millions of shares of stock .",0
416,"Alternatively , a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal - Mart for $ 45 and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $ 60 , for a gain of $ 15 .",0
417,The increase in the value of the stock ( or of any asset ) between when it is bought and when it is sold is called a capital gain .,1
418,A larger law firm may be owned jointly by its partners .,0
419,"Most private companies are relatively small , but there are some large private corporations , with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales , that do not have publicly issued stock , such as farm products dealer Cargill , the Mars candy company , and the Bechtel engineering and construction firm . When a firm decides to sell stock , which in turn can be bought and sold by financial investors , it is called a public company .",1
420,Shareholders own a public company .,0
421,"The expected rate of return refers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the investor , either in future interest payments , capital gains , or increased profitability .",1
422,"It is usually the average return over a period of time , usually in years or even decades .",0
423,Another way to deposit savings at a bank is to use a certificate of deposit ( CD ) .,0
424,"With a CD , as it is commonly called , you agree to deposit a certain amount of money , often measured in thousands of dollars , in the account for a stated period of time , typically ranging from a few months to several years .",1
425,A bond is basically an “ I owe you ” note that is given to an investor in exchange for capital ( money ) .,0
426,The bond has a face value .,0
427,This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity .,1
428,The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment .,1
429,"Combining the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and maturity date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to compute a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond .",1
430,This may or may not be the same as the face value .,0
431,"The trend in the stock market is generally up over time , but with some large dips along the way .",0
432,[ link ] shows the path of the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index ( which is measured on the left - hand vertical axis ) and the Dow Jones Index ( which is measured on the right - hand vertical axis ) .,0
433,"Broad measures of the stock market , like the ones listed here , tend to move together .",0
434,"At the other end of the spectrum , a mutual fund might be quite broad ; at the extreme , some mutual funds own a tiny share of every firm in the stock market , and thus the value of the mutual fund will fluctuate with the average of the overall stock market .",0
435,A mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the overall performance of the market is called an index fund .,1
436,Simple interest is an interest rate calculation only on the principal amount .,1
437,A rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make a difference .,1
438,"This theory of rational ignorance holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming informed and voting are too high , or they feel their vote will not be decisive in the election . In a 1957 work , An Economic Theory of Democracy , the economist Anthony Downs stated the problem this way : “ It seems probable that for a great many citizens in a democracy , rational behavior excludes any investment whatever in political information per se .",1
439,"No matter how significant a difference between parties is revealed to the rational citizen by his free information , or how uncertain he is about which party to support , he realizes that his vote has almost no chance of influencing the outcome … He will not even utilize all the free information available , since assimilating it takes time . ” In his classic 1948 novel Walden Two , the psychologist B. F. Skinner puts the issue even more succinctly via one of his characters , who states : “ The chance that one man ’s vote will decide the issue in a national election … is less than the chance that he will be killed on his way to the polls . ” The following Clear It Up feature explores another aspect of the election process : spending .",0
440,( See the closing Bring It Home feature at the end of this chapter for more information on the tire tariff .,0
441,") Special interest groups are groups that are small in number relative to the nation , but quite well organized and focused on a specific issue .",1
442,A special interest group can pressure legislators to enact public policies that do not benefit society as a whole .,0
443,"In the early 2000s , about 40 million people in the United States were eligible for Medicare , a government program that provides health insurance for those 65 and older .",1
444,"On some issues , the elderly are a powerful interest group .",0
445,"In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , which became known as “ Obamacare , ” there was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies .",0
446,"However , a lobby group , Health Care for America Now ( HCAN ) , was financed by labor unions and community groups and was organized to offset corporate lobbying .",0
447,"HCAN , spending $ 60 million dollars , was successful in helping to get the legislation passed which added new regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health insurance by 2014 .",0
448,"A nonprofit watchdog organization , called Citizens against Government Waste , produces an annual report , the Pig Book that attempts to quantify the amount of pork - barrel spending , focusing on items that were requested by only one member of Congress , that were passed into law without any public hearings , or that serve only a local purpose .",1
449,"Whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial , of course , but at least by this measure , pork - barrel spending totaled $ 2.7 billion in 2014.Pork - barrel spending can be encouraged by logrolling , an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they individually favor .",1
450,"For example , if one member of the U.S. Congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in his or her own congressional district , the other members might oppose it .",0
451,This case goes against the theory of the “ median ” voter in a democracy .,0
452,The median voter theory argues that politicians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter preferences .,1
453,"If we think of political positions along a spectrum from left to right , the median voter is in the middle of the spectrum .",0
454,These three insights seldom lead to simple or obvious political conclusions .,0
455,"As the famous British economist Joan Robinson wrote some decades ago : “ [ E]conomic theory , in itself , preaches no doctrines and can not establish any universally valid laws .",0
456,"It is a method of ordering ideas and formulating questions . ” The study of economics is neither politically conservative , nor moderate , nor liberal .",0
457,How large is the U.S. economy ?,0
458,"The size of a nation ’s overall economy is typically measured by its gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year .",1
459,"The measurement of GDP involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services — smart phones , cars , music downloads , computers , steel , bananas , college educations , and all other new goods and services produced in the current year — and summing them into a total dollar value .",0
460,"If Starbucks builds a new store , or Amazon buys robots , these expenditures are counted under business investment .",0
461,"Investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand , typically accounting for only about 15–18 % of GDP , but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created .",0
462,"However , it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption .",0
463,"Since the early 1980s , imports have typically exceeded exports , and so the United States has experienced a trade deficit in most years .",0
464,"Indeed , the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s .",0
465,They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year .,0
466,"Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the mistake of double counting , in which output is counted more than once as it travels through the stages of production .",1
467,"For example , imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires produced by a tire manufacturer , and then counted the value of a new truck sold by an automaker that contains those tires .",0
468,One of the closest cousins of GDP is the gross national product ( GNP ) .,0
469,GDP includes only what is produced within a country ’s borders .,0
470,GDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy .,1
471,"We explore price indices in detail and how they are computed in Inflation , but this definition will do in the context of this chapter .",0
472,The generally upward long - term path of GDP has been regularly interrupted by short - term declines .,0
473,A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession .,1
474,An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .,1
475,[ link ] lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900 .,0
476,"The highest point of the economy , before the recession begins , is called the peak ; conversely , the lowest point of a recession , before a recovery begins , is called the trough .",1
477,"Thus , a recession lasts from peak to trough , and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak .",0
478,"To compare the GDP of countries with different currencies , it is necessary to convert to a “ common denominator ” using an exchange rate , which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency .",1
479,"Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A ’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B ’s currency ( for example , Japanese yen per British pound ) , or as the inverse ( for example , British pounds per Japanese yen ) .",0
480,"Let ’s begin with a brief overview of the spectacular patterns of economic growth around the world in the last two centuries , commonly referred to as the period of modern economic growth .",1
481,( Later in the chapter we will discuss lower rates of economic growth and some key ingredients for economic progress . ),0
482,Economic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition .,0
483,"Richard Easterlin , an economist at the University of Southern California , wrote in 2000 :",0
484,"A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm , or perhaps an industry .",1
485,"In macroeconomics , the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function .",1
486,The category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment used by firms and also things like roads ( also called infrastructure ) .,1
487,"Again , greater physical capital implies more output .",0
488,"To obtain a per capita production function , divide each input in [ link](a ) by the population .",0
489,"This creates a second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per capita ( that is , GDP divided by population ) .",1
490,"The inputs are the average level of human capital per person , the average level of physical capital per person , and the level of technology per person — see [ link](b ) .",0
491,The European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research .,0
492,The researchers Abraham García and Pierre Mohnen demonstrate that firms which received support from the Austrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales .,0
493,Governments can support scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies .,0
494,"High - income countries must continually invent new technologies , whereas low - income countries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood .",0
495,"The economist Alexander Gerschenkron ( 1904–1978 ) gave this phenomenon a memorable name : “ the advantages of backwardness . ” Of course , he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living .",0
496,He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up .,0
497,"It also includes those who do want a job but have quit looking , often due to being discouraged by their inability to find suitable employment .",0
498,Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor force or not in the labor force .,0
499,Another important statistic is the labor force participation rate .,0
500,This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job .,1
501,One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the Census .,0
502,"But a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low - income countries , most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly .",0
503,"Instead , workers in these countries are engaged in short - term work , subsistence activities , and barter .",0
504,"From the standpoint of the supply - and - demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets , unemployment represents something of a puzzle .",0
505,"In a supply - and - demand model of a labor market , as illustrated in [ link ] , the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity .",1
506,"At the equilibrium wage ( We ) , the equilibrium quantity ( Qe ) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers .",0
507,"Economists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy , not just a few .",0
508,"A number of different theories have been proposed , but they share a common tone .",0
509,"The adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers , then the best workers , those with the best employment alternatives at other firms , are the most likely to leave .",1
510,"The least attractive workers , with fewer employment alternatives , are more likely to stay .",0
511,"Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies , through good economic years and bad ?",0
512,Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy : it is called the natural rate of unemployment .,1
513,Another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment .,0
514,"The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market , either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have , or because they never learned any skills .",1
515,"Moreover , the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services , but wages and income levels , too .",0
516,The second - to - last row of [ link ] shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased nearly six - fold from 1970 to 2014 .,0
517,Step 1 .,0
518,Find the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time periods .,0
519,"The general equation for percentage changes between two years , whether in the context of inflation or in any other calculation , is :",0
520,The most commonly cited measure of inflation in the United States is the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) .,0
521,The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four .,1
522,"If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years , until its price is already lower , the CPI may miss counting this price decline altogether .",0
523,"Taking these arguments together , the quality / new goods bias means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living .",1
524,The following Clear It Up feature is a must - read on how the CPI is comprised and calculated .,0
525,"It can be broken down into price indices for different industries , commodities , and stages of processing ( like finished goods , intermediate goods , crude materials for further processing , and so on ) .",0
526,There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported .,0
527,An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .,1
528,The first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms : they are right after World War I and World War II .,0
529,"However , there are also two periods of severe negative inflation — called deflation — in the early decades of the twentieth century : one following the deep recession of 1920–21 and the other during the Great Depression of the 1930s .",1
530,"( Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced , deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases . )",0
531,"Economists usually oppose high inflation , but they oppose it in a milder way than many non - economists .",0
532,"Robert Shiller , one of 2013 ’s Nobel Prize winners in economics , carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes toward inflation .",0
533,"One of his questions asked , “ Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority , as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools ? ” Answers were on a scale of 1–5 , where 1 meant “ Fully agree ” and 5 meant “ Completely disagree . ” For the U.S. population as a whole , 52 % answered “ Fully agree ” that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just 4 % said “ Completely disagree . ” However , among professional economists , only 18 % answered “ Fully agree , ” while the same percentage of 18 % answered “ Completely disagree.”The Land of Funny Money",0
534,"If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change .",0
535,"However , if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation , or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag , then inflation can cause three types of problems : unintended redistributions of purchasing power , blurred price signals , and difficulties in long - term planning .",0
536,One sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time : retirees who receive a private company pension .,0
537,Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement .,1
538,"For this reason , pensions are called “ defined benefits ” plans .",0
539,High and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker .,1
540,"Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly , and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages .",0
541,"When a price , wage , or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation , it is said to be indexed .",1
542,An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation .,1
543,"Loans often have built - in inflation adjustments , too , so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points , then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by two percentage points as well .",0
544,An adjustable - rate mortgage ( ARM ) is a kind of loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation .,1
545,"Often , a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an ARM , compared to a fixed - rate loan .",0
546,"The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase .",1
547,"Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .",0
548,"At some point , foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries .",0
549,"The economy then drops into deep recession , with real GDP often falling up to 10 % or more in a single year .",0
550,This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1 % .,0
551,"Do not confuse the balance of trade ( which tracks imports and exports ) , with the current account balance , which includes not just exports and imports , but also income from investment and transfers .",0
552,"Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades .",0
553,"For example , U.S. exports of services were equal to about one - half of U.S. exports of goods in 2014 , compared to one - fifth in 1980.The third component of the current account balance , labeled “ income payments , ” refers to money received by U.S. financial investors on their foreign investments ( money flowing into the United States ) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here ( money flowing out of the United States ) .",1
554,"The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade , along with goods and services , is that , from an economic perspective , income is just as much an economic transaction as shipments of cars or wheat or oil : it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market .",0
555,"As economists see it , trade surpluses can be either good or bad , depending on circumstances , and trade deficits can be good or bad , too .",0
556,The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital .,0
557,"In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways : a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday , and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments .",0
558,Investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country .,0
559,"Similarly , we see on the bottom third line , an investment from rest of the world into the home country and investment income ( bottom fourth line ) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world .",0
560,"The investment income ( bottom lines two and four ) are found in the current account , while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country ( lines one and three ) are found in the financial account .",0
561,The fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true .,0
562,Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital .,0
563,"When Japan ’s economy was growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s , its large trade surpluses were often described , especially by non - economists , as either a cause or a result of its robust economic health .",0
564,"But from a standpoint of economic growth , Japan ’s economy has been teetering in and out of recession since 1990 , with real GDP growth averaging only about 1 % per year , and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher .",0
565,"Clearly , a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health .",0
566,How is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate ?,0
567,"Is there a reason why unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions : lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000 , higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s , lower unemployment and higher inflation in the mid-2000s , and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009 ?",0
568,"Why did the current account deficit rise so high , but then decline in 2009 ?",0
569,Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767–1832 ) .,0
570,"Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view . The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .",1
571,The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall .,0
572,"Nevertheless , a recession is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes .",0
573,"A recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size , business failures outnumber the remaining success stories , and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers . Say ’s law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good approximation for the long run .",1
574,We use a variety of cues in a visual scene to establish our sense of depth .,0
575,"Some of these are binocular cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes .",1
576,"One example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives .",1
577,"The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea .",0
578,"The cochlea is a fluid - filled , snail - shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells ( hair cells ) of the auditory system ( [ link ] ) .",1
579,We ’ll discuss two of them here : temporal theory and place theory .,0
580,The temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the activity level of a sensory neuron .,1
581,This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to the frequency of the sound wave .,0
582,Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields .,0
583,"Like the monocular and binocular cues that provided information about depth , the auditory system uses both monaural ( one - eared ) and binaural ( two - eared ) cues to localize sound .",1
584,Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear .,1
585,"Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness .",1
586,"When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called sensorineural hearing loss .",1
587,One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .,0
588,"This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option .",0
589,"Cochlear implants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone , a speech processor , and an electrode array .",1
590,The device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain .,0
591,"You have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste : sweet , salty , sour , and bitter .",0
592,"Research demonstrates , however , that we have at least six taste groupings .",0
593,Umami is our fifth taste .,0
594,Olfactory receptor cells are located in a mucous membrane at the top of the nose .,1
595,Small hair - like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions ( [ link ] ) .,0
596,"These receptors include Meissner ’s corpuscles , Pacinian corpuscles , Merkel ’s disks , and Ruffini corpuscles .",0
597,"Meissner ’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations , and Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations .",1
598,"Merkel ’s disks respond to light pressure , while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch ( Abraira & Ginty , 2013).There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each attuned to specific touch - related stimuli .",1
599,"Generally speaking , pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature .",0
600,Pain that signals some type of tissue damage is known as inflammatory pain .,1
601,"In some situations , pain results from damage to neurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system .",0
602,The vestibular sense contributes to our ability to maintain balance and body posture .,1
603,"As [ link ] shows , the major sensory organs ( utricle , saccule , and the three semicircular canals ) of this system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear .",0
604,One Gestalt principle is the figure - ground relationship .,0
605,"According to this principle , we tend to segment our visual world into figure and ground .",1
606,Two additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity ( or good continuation ) and closure .,0
607,"The law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous , smooth flowing lines rather than jagged , broken lines ( [ link ] ) .",1
608,"You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case .",0
609,Our perceptions are based on perceptual hypotheses : educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information .,1
610,"These hypotheses are informed by a number of factors , including our personalities , experiences , and expectations .",0
611,Both instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors that organisms are born with .,0
612,Reflexes are a motor or neural reaction to a specific stimulus in the environment .,1
613,"They tend to be simpler than instincts , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the knee - jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light ) , and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) .",0
614,Our minds have a natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence .,0
615,Associative learning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment .,1
616,"You will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed in this chapter ; classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes , operant conditioning tends to involve conscious processes , and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basic associative processes , both conscious and unconscious .",0
617,"Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) .",0
618,"As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events . Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning .",1
619,""""" >",0
620,Pavlov would sound a tone ( like ringing a bell ) and then give the dogs the meat powder ( [ link ] ) .,0
621,"The tone was the neutral stimulus ( NS ) , which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response .",1
622,"Prior to conditioning , the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for the dogs .",0
623,Tiger will learn to get excited when she hears the “ squeak ” of the cabinet .,0
624,"Pairing a new neutral stimulus ( “ squeak ” ) with the conditioned stimulus ( “ zzhzhz ” ) is called higher - order conditioning , or second - order conditioning .",1
625,This means you are using the conditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus : the squeaky cabinet ( [ link ] ) .,0
626,Soon the dogs stopped responding to the tone .,0
627,Extinction is the decrease in the conditioned response when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus .,1
628,"When presented with the conditioned stimulus alone , the dog , cat , or other organism would show a weaker and weaker response , and finally no response .",0
629,"On the other hand , when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus , it is called stimulus generalization , the opposite of stimulus discrimination .",1
630,"The more similar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus , the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned response .",0
631,"His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .",0
632,"According to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated ( Thorndike , 1911 ) .",1
633,"Essentially , if an organism does something that brings about a desired result , the organism is more likely to do it again .",0
634,"Remember that reinforcement , even when it is negative , always increases a behavior .",0
635,"In contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior .",1
636,"In positive punishment , you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior .",1
637,"ShapingIn his operant conditioning experiments , Skinner often used an approach called shaping .",0
638,"Instead of rewarding only the target behavior , in shaping , we reward successive approximations of a target behavior .",1
639,Why is shaping needed ?,0
640,"With a variable interval reinforcement schedule , the person or animal gets the reinforcement based on varying amounts of time , which are unpredictable .",1
641,Say that Manuel is the manager at a fast - food restaurant .,0
642,"Although strict behaviorists such as Skinner and Watson refused to believe that cognition ( such as thoughts and expectations ) plays a role in learning , another behaviorist , Edward C. Tolman , had a different opinion .",0
643,"Tolman ’s experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn even if they do not receive immediate reinforcement ( Tolman & Honzik , 1930 ; Tolman , Ritchie , & Kalish , 1946 ) .",0
644,"Previous sections of this chapter focused on classical and operant conditioning , which are forms of associative learning .",0
645,"In observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating , or modeling , what they do or say .",1
646,The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models .,1
647,"Bandura and other researchers proposed a brand of behaviorism called social learning theory , which took cognitive processes into account .",0
648,"According to Bandura , pure behaviorism could not explain why learning can take place in the absence of external reinforcement .",0
649,He felt that internal mental states must also have a role in learning and that observational learning involves much more than imitation .,0
650,What are the implications of this study ?,0
651,"Bandura concluded that we watch and learn , and that this learning can have both prosocial and antisocial effects .",0
652,Prosocial ( positive ) models can be used to encourage socially acceptable behavior .,0
653,The different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts .,0
654,"Concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information , images , ideas , or memories , such as life experiences .",1
655,"Concepts are , in many ways , big ideas that are generated by observing details , and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive structures .",0
656,"An artificial concept , on the other hand , is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics .",1
657,"Various properties of geometric shapes , like squares and triangles , serve as useful examples of artificial concepts .",0
658,"Thus , lexicon is a language ’s vocabulary .",1
659,"Grammar refers to the set of rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon ( Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .",1
660,"For instance , English grammar dictates that most verbs receive an “ -ed ” at the end to indicate past tense .",0
661,Semantics and syntax are part of a language ’s grammar .,0
662,Semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words .,1
663,"Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .",1
664,B. F. Skinner ( 1957 ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement .,0
665,"Noam Chomsky ( 1965 ) criticized this behaviorist approach , asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined .",0
666,The use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears to follow a very similar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds .,0
667,Different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) .,0
668,"For example , a well - known strategy is trial and error .",0
669,"The old adage , “ If at first you do n’t succeed , try , try again ” describes trial and error .",0
670,The realtor may be challenging your anchoring bias .,0
671,An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem .,1
672,"In this case , you ’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs .",1
673,"Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t .",1
674,"In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did .",0
675,"Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors .",1
676,Motivation describes the wants or needs that direct behavior toward a goal .,1
677,"In addition to biological motives , motivations can be intrinsic ( arising from internal factors ) or extrinsic ( arising from external factors ) ( [ link ] ) .",1
678,"Intrinsically motivated behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they bring , while extrinsically motivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others .",1
679,"According to the drive theory of motivation , deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs .",1
680,"These needs result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and , ultimately , bring the system back to homeostasis .",0
681,"Self - efficacy is an individual ’s belief in her own capability to complete a task , which may include a previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task .",1
682,Albert Bandura ( 1994 ) theorized that an individual ’s sense of self - efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior .,0
683,"In the 1940s , Raymond Cattell proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into two components : crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence ( Cattell , 1963 ) .",0
684,Crystallized intelligence is characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it .,1
685,"When you learn , remember , and recall information , you are using crystallized intelligence .",0
686,"Practical intelligence , as proposed by Sternberg , is sometimes compared to “ street smarts . ” Being practical means you find solutions that work in your everyday life by applying knowledge based on your experiences .",1
687,"This type of intelligence appears to be separate from traditional understanding of IQ ; individuals who score high in practical intelligence may or may not have comparable scores in creative and analytical intelligence ( Sternberg , 1988 ) .",0
688,"Multiple Intelligences Theory was developed by Howard Gardner , a Harvard psychologist and former student of Erik Erikson .",0
689,"Gardner ’s theory , which has been refined for more than 30 years , is a more recent development among theories of intelligence .",0
690,"Creativity is the ability to generate , create , or discover new ideas , solutions , and possibilities .",1
691,"Very creative people often have intense knowledge about something , work on it for years , look at novel solutions , seek out the advice and help of other experts , and take risks .",0
692,"For most people , once they have eaten , they feel satiation , or fullness and satisfaction , and their eating behavior stops .",0
693,"Like the initiation of eating , satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms .",0
694,"Our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels of activity , but our body ’s metabolic rate also comes into play .",0
695,"A person ’s metabolic rate is the amount of energy that is expended in a given period of time , and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic rates .",1
696,People with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower rates of metabolism .,0
697,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , an adult with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight ( [ link ] ) .",1
698,"An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] , 2012 ) .",1
699,People who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese .,1
700,Prader - Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) is a genetic disorder that results in persistent feelings of intense hunger and reduced rates of metabolism .,1
701,"Typically , affected children have to be supervised around the clock to ensure that they do not engage in excessive eating .",0
702,Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation and/or excessive exercise .,1
703,"Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image , referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia , meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not .",0
704,"Kinsey also developed a continuum known as the Kinsey scale that is still commonly used today to categorize an individual ’s sexual orientation ( Jenkins , 2010 ) .",1
705,"Sexual orientation is an individual ’s emotional and erotic attractions to same - sexed individuals ( homosexual ) , opposite - sexed individuals ( heterosexual ) , or both ( bisexual ) .",1
706,"Based on these observations , Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women : excitement , plateau , orgasm , and resolution ( [ link ] ) .",1
707,"The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .",1
708,"During plateau , women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora , and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre - ejaculatory fluid .",1
709,"In men , pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles , ( i.e. , ejaculation ) .",0
710,Resolution is the relatively rapid return to an unaroused state accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure and muscular relaxation .,1
711,"While many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution .",0
712,"When individuals do not feel comfortable identifying with the gender associated with their biological sex , then they experience gender dysphoria .",0
713,Gender dysphoria is a diagnostic category in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) that describes individuals who do not identify as the gender that most people would assume they are .,1
714,This dysphoria must persist for at least six months and result in significant distress or dysfunction to meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria .,0
715,"As a result , the test was normed and standardized , which means that the test was administered consistently to a large enough representative sample of the population that the range of scores resulted in a bell curve ( bell curves will be discussed later ) .",0
716,"Standardization means that the manner of administration , scoring , and interpretation of results is consistent .",1
717,"Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups , such as age groups .",1
718,"Without a large sample size , it is less likely that the bell curve will represent the wider population .",0
719,A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately represents the general population .,1
720,"If , for example , you measured the height of the women in your classroom only , you might not actually have a representative sample .",0
721,The Schachter - Singer two - factor theory of emotion is another variation on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience .,0
722,"According to this theory , emotions are composed of two factors : physiological and cognitive .",1
723,"THE BIOLOGY OF EMOTIONSEarlier , you learned about the limbic system , which is the area of the brain involved in emotion and memory ( [ link ] ) .",1
724,"The limbic system includes the hypothalamus , thalamus , amygdala , and the hippocampus .",0
725,It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory .,0
726,"The central nucleus plays a role in attention , and it has connections with the hypothalamus and various brainstem areas to regulate the autonomic nervous and endocrine systems’ activity ( Pessoa , 2010 ) .",0
727,"This would seem to suggest that the pattern of activity in facial muscles involved in generating emotional expressions is universal , and indeed , this idea was suggested in the late 19th century in Charles Darwin ’s book The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals ( 1872 ) .",0
728,"In fact , there is substantial evidence for seven universal emotions that are each associated with distinct facial expressions .",0
729,"These include : happiness , surprise , sadness , fright , disgust , contempt , and anger ( [ link ] ) ( Ekman & Keltner , 1997 ) .",0
730,"Personality refers to the long - standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think , feel , and behave in specific ways .",1
731,Our personality is what makes us unique individuals .,0
732,"According to Freud , unconscious drives influenced by sex and aggression , along with childhood sexuality , are the forces that influence our personality .",0
733,Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality .,1
734,"These theorists , referred to as neo - Freudians , generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter , but they reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality .",0
735,"The unconscious i d contains our most primitive drives or urges , and is present from birth .",1
736,"It directs impulses for hunger , thirst , and sex .",0
737,"According to Freud , a person who has a strong ego , which can balance the demands of the i d and the superego , has a healthy personality .",0
738,"Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to neurosis ( a tendency to experience negative emotions ) , anxiety disorders , or unhealthy behaviors .",1
739,"For example , a person who is dominated by their i d might be narcissistic and impulsive .",0
740,"In projection , a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else .",1
741,"Other defense mechanisms include rationalization , displacement , and sublimation .",0
742,"After passing through the oral stage , children enter what Freud termed the anal stage ( 1–3 years ) .",0
743,"In this stage , children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements , so it makes sense that the conflict in this stage is over toilet training .",1
744,The final stage is the genital stage ( from puberty on ) .,0
745,"In this stage , there is a sexual reawakening as the incestuous urges resurface .",1
746,"He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .",1
747,"Adler ( 1937 , 1956 ) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex .",0
748,An inferiority complex refers to a person ’s feelings that they lack worth and do n’t measure up to the standards of others or of society .,1
749,"The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory traces , which are common to all of us ( Jung , 1928 ) . These ancestral memories , which Jung called archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures , as expressed through literature , art , and dreams ( Jung ) .",1
750,"Memory is an information processing system ; therefore , we often compare it to a computer .",0
751,"Memory is the set of processes used to encode , store , and retrieve information over different periods of time ( [ link]).Encoding involves the input of information into the memory system .",1
752,Storage is the retention of the encoded information .,1
753,It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information .,1
754,This is known as effortful processing ( [ link ] ) .,0
755,"Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding , especially if we apply what is called the self - reference effect .",0
756,"The self - reference effect is the tendency for an individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less personal relevance ( Rogers , Kuiper & Kirker , 1977 ) .",1
757,Could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you attempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter ?,0
758,"In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .",0
759,These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin ( 1968 ) .,0
760,"Their model of human memory ( [ link ] ) , called Atkinson - Shiffrin ( A - S ) , is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information .",1
761,Short - term memory ( STM ) is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory ; sometimes it is called working memory .,1
762,Short - term memory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already in long - term memory .,0
763,Understanding the different types is important because a person ’s age or particular types of brain trauma or disorders can leave certain types of LTM intact while having disastrous consequences for other types .,0
764,Explicit memories are those we consciously try to remember and recall .,1
765,"For example , if you are studying for your chemistry exam , the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory .",0
766,Declarative memory has to do with the storage of facts and events we personally experienced .,1
767,Explicit ( declarative ) memory has two parts : semantic memory and episodic memory .,0
768,"Can you remember every event you have experienced over the course of your life — meals , conversations , clothing choices , weather conditions , and so on ?",0
769,"Most likely none of us could even come close to answering these questions ; however , American actress Marilu Henner , best known for the television show Taxi , can remember .",0
770,She has an amazing and highly superior autobiographical memory ( [ link ] ) .,0
771,"There are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long - term memory storage system : recall , recognition , and relearning .",0
772,Recall is what we most often think about when we talk about memory retrieval : it means you can access information without cues .,1
773,"For example , you would use recall for an essay test .",0
774,"Karl Lashley began exploring this problem , about 100 years ago , by making lesions in the brains of animals such as rats and monkeys .",0
775,"He was searching for evidence of the engram : the group of neurons that serve as the “ physical representation of memory ” ( Josselyn , 2010 ) .",1
776,"First , Lashley ( 1950 ) trained rats to find their way through a maze .",0
777,Another group of researchers also experimented with rats to learn how the hippocampus functions in memory processing ( [ link ] ) .,0
778,"They created lesions in the hippocampi of the rats , and found that the rats demonstrated memory impairment on various tasks , such as object recognition and maze running .",0
779,"It is also believed that strong emotions trigger the formation of strong memories , and weaker emotional experiences form weaker memories ; this is called arousal theory ( Christianson , 1992 ) .",1
780,"For example , strong emotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters , as well as hormones , which strengthen memory ; therefore , our memory for an emotional event is usually better than our memory for a non - emotional event .",0
781,Albert Bandura agreed with Skinner that personality develops through learning .,0
782,"He disagreed , however , with Skinner ’s strict behaviorist approach to personality development , because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning .",0
783,"Bandura ( 1977 , 1995 ) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and personality development , and most recently has focused on the concept of self - efficacy .",0
784,"Self - efficacy is our level of confidence in our own abilities , developed through our social experiences .",1
785,Self - efficacy affects how we approach challenges and reach goals .,0
786,"Walter Mischel was a student of Julian Rotter and taught for years at Stanford , where he was a colleague of Albert Bandura .",0
787,"Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait prediction of behavior , and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology .",0
788,Retrograde amnesia is loss of memory for events that occurred prior to the trauma .,1
789,People with retrograde amnesia can not remember some or even all of their past .,0
790,"In studying cases where DNA evidence has exonerated people from crimes , the Innocence Project discovered that eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions ( Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law , Yeshiva University , 2009 ) .",0
791,""""" >",0
792,Recall of false autobiographical memories is called false memory syndrome .,1
793,"This syndrome has received a lot of publicity , particularly as it relates to memories of events that do not have independent witnesses — often the only witnesses to the abuse are the perpetrator and the victim ( e.g. , sexual abuse ) .",0
794,"I know I read the book in high school , and I remember that one of the main characters is named Scout , and her father is an attorney , but I honestly do n’t remember anything else . ” Nathan wonders if his mother actually read the book , and his mother is surprised she ca n’t recall the plot .",0
795,"What is going on here is storage decay : unused information tends to fade with the passage of time . In 1885 , German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus analyzed the process of memorization .",1
796,"First , he memorized lists of nonsense syllables .",0
797,"Memories can also be affected by bias , which is the final distortion error .",0
798,Schacter ( 2001 ) says that your feelings and view of the world can actually distort your memory of past events .,0
799,These are examples of proactive interference : when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information .,0
800,Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information .,1
801,"For example , this week you are studying about Freud ’s Psychoanalytic Theory .",0
802,Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers .,0
803,"One of Rogers ’s main ideas about personality regards self - concept , our thoughts and feelings about ourselves .",1
804,"How would you respond to the question , “ Who am I ? ” Your answer can show how you see yourself .",0
805,"According to Rogers ( 1980 ) , “ As persons are accepted and prized , they tend to develop a more caring attitude towards themselves ” ( p. 116 ) .",0
806,"Conversely , when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and actual selves , we experience a state Rogers called incongruence , which can lead to maladjustment .",1
807,"Some of these are binocular cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes .",1
808,"One example of a binocular depth cue is binocular disparity , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives .",1
809,"To experience this slightly different view , do this simple exercise : extend your arm fully and extend one of your fingers and focus on that finger .",0
810,The place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to sounds of different frequencies .,1
811,"More specifically , the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies .",0
812,"If a sound comes from an off - center location , it creates two types of binaural cues : interaural level differences and interaural timing differences .",0
813,Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head .,1
814,Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear ( [ link ] ) .,1
815,Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear .,1
816,"Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness .",1
817,"Many others begin to suffer from conductive hearing loss because of age , genetic predisposition , or environmental effects , including exposure to extreme noise ( noise - induced hearing loss , as shown in [ link ] ) , certain illnesses ( such as measles or mumps ) , or damage due to toxins ( such as those found in certain solvents and metals ) .",0
818,"When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called sensorineural hearing loss .",1
819,One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .,0
820,"Although not well understood , Ménière 's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , tinnitus ( constant ringing or buzzing ) , vertigo ( a sense of spinning ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( Semaan & Megerian , 2011 ) .",1
821,"In the United States and other places around the world , deaf people have their own language , schools , and customs .",1
822,This is called deaf culture .,0
823,"In the United States , deaf individuals often communicate using American Sign Language ( ASL ) ; ASL has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures .",1
824,Umami is our fifth taste .,0
825,"Umami is actually a Japanese word that roughly translates to yummy , and it is associated with a taste for monosodium glutamate ( Kinnamon & Vandenbeuch , 2009 ) .",1
826,"There is also a growing body of experimental evidence suggesting that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food ( Mizushige , Inoue , & Fushiki , 2007 ) .",0
827,Small hair - like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions ( [ link ] ) .,0
828,"Once an odor molecule has bound a given receptor , chemical changes within the cell result in signals being sent to the olfactory bulb : a bulb - like structure at the tip of the frontal lobe where the olfactory nerves begin .",1
829,"From the olfactory bulb , information is sent to regions of the limbic system and to the primary olfactory cortex , which is located very near the gustatory cortex ( Lodovichi & Belluscio , 2012 ; Spors et al . , 2013 ) .",0
830,"Meissner ’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations , and Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations .",1
831,"Merkel ’s disks respond to light pressure , while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch ( Abraira & Ginty , 2013).There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin , each attuned to specific touch - related stimuli .",0
832,"As a result , pain signals that are sent to the brain get exaggerated .",1
833,This type of pain is known as neuropathic pain .,0
834,Multiple treatment options for pain relief range from relaxation therapy to the use of analgesic medications to deep brain stimulation .,0
835,"The law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous , smooth flowing lines rather than jagged , broken lines ( [ link ] ) .",1
836,The principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into complete objects rather than as a series of parts ( [ link ] ) .,1
837,"In this chapter , you have learned that perception is a complex process .",0
838,"Built from sensations , but influenced by our own experiences , biases , prejudices , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person .",1
839,Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception .,0
840,Does the name Ivan Pavlov ring a bell ?,0
841,"Even if you are new to the study of psychology , chances are that you have heard of Pavlov and his famous dogs .",0
842,"In Pavlov ’s experiments , the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them .",0
843,The meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism .,1
844,The dogs’ salivation was an unconditioned response ( UCR ) : a natural ( unlearned ) reaction to a given stimulus .,1
845,"When you finally got it fixed and started using it to open Tiger ’s food again , Tiger would remember the association between the can opener and her food — she would get excited and run to the kitchen when she heard the sound .",0
846,"The behavior of Pavlov ’s dogs and Tiger illustrates a concept Pavlov called spontaneous recovery : the return of a previously extinguished conditioned response following a rest period ( [ link]).This is the curve of acquisition , extinction , and spontaneous recovery .",1
847,The rising curve shows the conditioned response quickly getting stronger through the repeated pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus ( acquisition ) .,0
848,"But if you do not feed her following the electric mixer sound , and you continue to feed her consistently after the electric can opener sound , she will quickly learn to discriminate between the two sounds ( provided they are sufficiently dissimilar that she can tell them apart).Sometimes , classical conditioning can lead to habituation .",0
849,Habituation occurs when we learn not to respond to a stimulus that is presented repeatedly without change .,1
850,"As the stimulus occurs over and over , we learn not to focus our attention on it .",0
851,"Psychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively elicited , and it does n’t account for new behaviors such as riding a bike .",1
852,He proposed a theory about how such behaviors come about .,0
853,The most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement .,0
854,"In positive reinforcement , a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior .",1
855,"In contrast , punishment always decreases a behavior .",0
856,"In positive punishment , you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior .",1
857,An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop texting in class .,0
858,"How about Joaquin , the soccer player ?",0
859,"If you gave Joaquin a piece of candy every time he made a goal , you would be using a primary reinforcer .",0
860,Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that have innate reinforcing qualities .,1
861,"Watch this video clip where veterinarian Dr. Sophia Yin shapes a dog ’s behavior using the steps outlined above . Once a behavior is trained , researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcement schedule — partial reinforcement .",0
862,"In partial reinforcement , also referred to as intermittent reinforcement , the person or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior .",1
863,There are several different types of partial reinforcement schedules ( [ link ] ) .,0
864,"With a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule , there are a set number of responses that must occur before the behavior is rewarded .",0
865,"Carla sells glasses at an eyeglass store , and she earns a commission every time she sells a pair of glasses .",0
866,He also studied a comparison group that was rewarded with food at the end of the maze .,0
867,"As the unreinforced rats explored the maze , they developed a cognitive map : a mental picture of the layout of the maze ( [ link ] ) .",1
868,"After 10 sessions in the maze without reinforcement , food was placed in a goal box at the end of the maze .",0
869,"In observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating , or modeling , what they do or say .",1
870,The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models .,1
871,"Research suggests that this imitative learning involves a specific type of neuron , called a mirror neuron ( Hickock , 2010 ; Rizzolatti , Fadiga , Fogassi , & Gallese , 2002 ; Rizzolatti , Fogassi , & Gallese , 2006 ) .",0
872,"If you saw that the model was reinforced for her behavior , you will be more motivated to copy her .",1
873,This is known as vicarious reinforcement .,0
874,"On the other hand , if you observed the model being punished , you would be less motivated to copy her .",0
875,This is only one facet of the complex processes involved in cognition .,0
876,"Simply put , cognition is thinking , and it encompasses the processes associated with perception , knowledge , problem solving , judgment , language , and memory .",1
877,"Scientists who study cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate , organize , and utilize our conscious cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing ( for example , Kahneman , 2011 ) .",0
878,Another technique used by your brain to organize information is the identification of prototypes for the concepts you have developed .,0
879,A prototype is the best example or representation of a concept .,1
880,"For example , for the category of civil disobedience , your prototype could be Rosa Parks .",0
881,"A schema is a mental construct consisting of a cluster or collection of related concepts ( Bartlett , 1932 ) .",1
882,"There are many different types of schemata , and they all have one thing in common : schemata are a method of organizing information that allows the brain to work more efficiently .",0
883,Language is a communication system that involves using words and systematic rules to organize those words to transmit information from one individual to another .,1
884,"While language is a form of communication , not all communication is language .",0
885,Words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language .,0
886,"A phoneme ( e.g. , the sounds “ ah ” vs. “ eh ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different languages have different sets of phonemes .",1
887,"Phonemes are combined to form morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ I ” is both a phoneme and a morpheme ) .",1
888,Semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words .,1
889,"Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Fernández & Cairns , 2011 ) .",1
890,Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they understand about those rules .,0
891,This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization .,0
892,"In this context , overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule .",1
893,Another type of strategy is an algorithm .,0
894,"An algorithm is a problem - solving formula that provides you with step - by - step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome ( Kahneman , 2011 ) .",1
895,You can think of an algorithm as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed .,0
896,"The person is stuck — but she just needs to go to another doorway , instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway .",0
897,A mental set is where you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working now .,1
898,An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem .,1
899,"In this case , you ’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point . The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs .",1
900,"For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis .",0
901,"Finally , the availability heuristic is a heuristic in which you make a decision based on an example , information , or recent experience that is that readily available to you , even though it may not be the best example to inform your decision .",1
902,"Biases tend to “ preserve that which is already established — to maintain our preexisting knowledge , beliefs , attitudes , and hypotheses ” ( Aronson , 1995 ; Kahneman , 2011 ) .",1
903,These biases are summarized in [ link ] .,0
904,"Interestingly , drive theory also emphasizes the role that habits play in the type of behavioral response in which we engage .",1
905,A habit is a pattern of behavior in which we regularly engage .,1
906,"Once we have engaged in a behavior that successfully reduces a drive , we are more likely to engage in that behavior whenever faced with that drive in the future ( Graham & Weiner , 1996 ) .",0
907,Analytical intelligence is closely aligned with academic problem solving and computations .,0
908,"Sternberg says that analytical intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to analyze , evaluate , judge , compare , and contrast .",1
909,Gardner ’s inter- and intrapersonal intelligences are often combined into a single type : emotional intelligence .,0
910,"Emotional intelligence encompasses the ability to understand the emotions of yourself and others , show empathy , understand social relationships and cues , and regulate your own emotions and respond in culturally appropriate ways ( Parker , Saklofske , & Stough , 2009 ) .",1
911,People with high emotional intelligence typically have well - developed social skills .,0
912,"As blood glucose levels increase , the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and eating ( Drazen & Woods , 2003 ; Druce , Small , & Bloom , 2004 ; Greary , 1990 ) .",0
913,"The food ’s passage through the gastrointestinal tract also provides important satiety signals to the brain ( Woods , 2004 ) , and fat cells release leptin , a satiety hormone .",1
914,This observation led some to propose a set - point theory of body weight regulation .,0
915,"The set - point theory asserts that each individual has an ideal body weight , or set point , which is resistant to change .",1
916,"This set - point is genetically predetermined and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set - point are resisted by compensatory changes in energy intake and/or expenditure ( Speakman et al . , 2011 ) .",0
917,People who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese .,0
918,Morbid obesity is defined as having a BMI over 40 .,1
919,"Note that although BMI has been used as a healthy weight indicator by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the CDC , and other groups , its value as an assessment tool has been questioned .",0
920,People suffering from bulimia nervosa engage in binge eating behavior that is followed by an attempt to compensate for the large amount of food consumed .,1
921,Purging the food by inducing vomiting or through the use of laxatives are two common compensatory behaviors .,0
922,Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average through starvation and/or excessive exercise .,1
923,"Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image , referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia , meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not .",1
924,"Like bulimia nervosa , anorexia nervosa is associated with a number of significant negative health outcomes : bone loss , heart failure , kidney failure , amenorrhea ( cessation of the menstrual period ) , reduced function of the gonads , and in extreme cases , death .",0
925,"MASTERS AND JOHNSON ’S RESEARCHIn 1966 , William Masters and Virginia Johnson published a book detailing the results of their observations of nearly 700 people who agreed to participate in their study of physiological responses during sexual behavior .",0
926,"Unlike Kinsey , who used personal interviews and surveys to collect data , Masters and Johnson observed people having intercourse in a variety of positions , and they observed people masturbating , manually or with the aid of a device .",0
927,"The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .",1
928,"During plateau , women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora , and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre - ejaculatory fluid .",0
929,Both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time .,0
930,"While many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle , men must pass through a longer refractory period as part of resolution .",0
931,The refractory period is a period of time that follows an orgasm during which an individual is incapable of experiencing another orgasm .,1
932,"In men , the duration of the refractory period can vary dramatically from individual to individual with some refractory periods as short as several minutes and others as long as a day .",0
933,This involves dressing in opposite - sex clothing and assuming an opposite - sex identity .,0
934,"These individuals may also undertake transgender hormone therapy in an attempt to make their bodies look more like the opposite sex , and in some cases , they elect to have surgeries to alter the appearance of their external genitalia to resemble that of their gender identity ( [ link ] ) .",0
935,"While these may sound like drastic changes , gender dysphoric individuals take these steps because their bodies seem to them to be a mistake of nature , and they seek to correct this mistake .",0
936,"Standardization means that the manner of administration , scoring , and interpretation of results is consistent .",1
937,"Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups , such as age groups .",1
938,"The resulting data provide norms , or referential scores , by which to interpret future scores .",0
939,The average IQ score on an IQ test is 100 .,0
940,Standard deviations describe how data are dispersed in a population and give context to large data sets .,1
941,The bell curve uses the standard deviation to show how all scores are dispersed from the average score ( [ link ] ) .,1
942,Range of Reaction is the theory that each person responds to the environment in a unique way based on his or her genetic makeup .,1
943,"According to this idea , your genetic potential is a fixed quantity , but whether you reach your full intellectual potential is dependent upon the environmental stimulation you experience , especially in childhood .",0
944,"As we move through our daily lives , we experience a variety of emotions .",0
945,An emotion is a subjective state of being that we often describe as our feelings .,1
946,"The words emotion and mood are sometimes used interchangeably , but psychologists use these words to refer to two different things .",0
947,The assumption is that most of us would show signs of physiological arousal if we were being dishonest with someone .,0
948,"A polygraph , or lie detector test , measures the physiological arousal of an individual responding to a series of questions .",1
949,Someone trained in reading these tests would look for answers to questions that are associated with increased levels of arousal as potential signs that the respondent may have been dishonest on those answers .,0
950,"AmygdalaThe amygdala has received a great deal of attention from researchers interested in understanding the biological basis for emotions , especially fear and anxiety ( Blackford & Pine , 2012 ; Goosens & Maren , 2002 ; Maren , Phan , & Liberzon , 2013 ) .",0
951,"The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei , including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) .",1
952,Or does being happy make you smile ?,0
953,"The facial feedback hypothesis asserts that facial expressions are capable of influencing our emotions , meaning that smiling can make you feel happier ( Buck , 1980 ; Soussignan , 2001 ; Strack , Martin , & Stepper , 1988 ) .",1
954,"Recent research explored how Botox , which paralyzes facial muscles and limits facial expression , might affect emotion .",1
955,"Hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four separate temperaments associated with four fluids ( “ humors ” ) of the body : choleric temperament ( yellow bile from the liver ) , melancholic temperament ( black bile from the kidneys ) , sanguine temperament ( red blood from the heart ) , and phlegmatic temperament ( white phlegm from the lungs ) ( Clark & Watson , 2008 ; Eysenck & Eysenck , 1985 ; Lecci & Magnavita , 2013 ; Noga , 2007 ) .",1
956,"Centuries later , the influential Greek physician and philosopher Galen built on Hippocrates ’s theory , suggesting that both diseases and personality differences could be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits one of the four temperaments .",1
957,"For example , the choleric person is passionate , ambitious , and bold ; the melancholic person is reserved , anxious , and unhappy ; the sanguine person is joyful , eager , and optimistic ; and the phlegmatic person is calm , reliable , and thoughtful ( Clark & Watson , 2008 ; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991 ) .",0
958,"When certain events , feelings , or yearnings cause an individual anxiety , the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety .",0
959,"To do that , the individual ’s unconscious mind uses ego defense mechanisms , unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety .",1
960,"The ego , usually conscious , resorts to unconscious strivings to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety .",1
961,"In each psychosexual stage of development , the child ’s pleasure - seeking urges , coming from the i d , are focused on a different area of the body , called an erogenous zone .",0
962,"The stages are oral , anal , phallic , latency , and genital ( [ link]).Freud ’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial .",0
963,"Freud ’s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage ( 3–6 years ) , corresponding to the age when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls .",1
964,The erogenous zone in this stage is the genitals .,0
965,"Alfred Adler , a colleague of Freud ’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society ( Freud ’s inner circle of colleagues ) , was the first major theorist to break away from Freud ( [ link ] ) .",0
966,"He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .",1
967,"As an art school dropout with an uncertain future , young Erik Erikson met Freud ’s daughter , Anna Freud , while he was tutoring the children of an American couple undergoing psychoanalysis in Vienna .",0
968,It was Anna Freud who encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis .,0
969,"The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious , holding mental patterns , or memory traces , which are common to all of us ( Jung , 1928 ) .",1
970,"These ancestral memories , which Jung called archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures , as expressed through literature , art , and dreams ( Jung ) .",1
971,"Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over , such as facing death , becoming independent , and striving for mastery .",0
972,"We get information into our brains through a process called encoding , which is the input of information into the memory system .",1
973,"Once we receive sensory information from the environment , our brains label or code it .",0
974,Our brains take the encoded information and place it in storage .,0
975,Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information .,1
976,"In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .",0
977,"( Note : Sometimes , but not always , the terms explicit memory and declarative memory are used interchangeably .",0
978,) Implicit memories are memories that are not part of our consciousness .,1
979,They are memories formed from behaviors .,0
980,Semantic means having to do with language and knowledge about language .,1
981,"An example would be the question “ what does argumentative mean ? ” Stored in our semantic memory is knowledge about words , concepts , and language - based knowledge and facts .",0
982,"For example , answers to the following questions are stored in your semantic memory :",0
983,"Very few people can recall events in this way ; right now , only 12 known individuals have this ability , and only a few have been studied ( Parker , Cahill & McGaugh 2006 ) .",0
984,"And although hyperthymesia normally appears in adolescence , two children in the United States appear to have memories from well before their tenth birthdays .",0
985,"For example , you would use recall for an essay test .",0
986,Recognition happens when you identify information that you have previously learned after encountering it again .,1
987,It involves a process of comparison .,0
988,"Although the hippocampus seems to be more of a processing area for explicit memories , you could still lose it and be able to create implicit memories ( procedural memory , motor learning , and classical conditioning ) , thanks to your cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .",0
989,"For example , one classical conditioning experiment is to accustom subjects to blink when they are given a puff of air .",0
990,"Julian Rotter ( 1966 ) proposed the concept of locus of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development .",1
991,"Distinct from self - efficacy , which involves our belief in our own abilities , locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives .",1
992,"AMNESIAAmnesia is the loss of long - term memory that occurs as the result of disease , physical trauma , or psychological trauma .",1
993,Psychologist Tulving ( 2002 ) and his colleagues at the University of Toronto studied K. C. for years .,0
994,"The formulation of new memories is sometimes called construction , and the process of bringing up old memories is called reconstruction .",1
995,"Yet as we retrieve our memories , we also tend to alter and modify them .",0
996,Contrast the Cotton case with what happened in the Elizabeth Smart case .,0
997,"When Elizabeth was 14 years old and fast asleep in her bed at home , she was abducted at knifepoint .",0
998,"“ I ’ve a grand memory for forgetting , ” quipped Robert Louis Stevenson .",0
999,Forgetting refers to loss of information from long - term memory .,1
1000,"We all forget things , like a loved one ’s birthday , someone ’s name , or where we put our car keys .",0
1001,"You probably answered yes to at least one , if not all , of these examples — but do n’t worry , you are not alone .",0
1002,We are all prone to committing the memory error known as absentmindedness .,0
1003,"These lapses in memory are caused by breaks in attention or our focus being somewhere else . Cynthia , a psychologist , recalls a time when she recently committed the memory error of absentmindedness .",1
1004,"How about a memory of a traumatic event , something you really do not want to think about ?",0
1005,"When you keep remembering something , to the point where you ca n’t “ get it out of your head ” and it interferes with your ability to concentrate on other things , it is called persistence .",1
1006,It ’s Schacter ’s seventh and last memory error .,0
1007,"As the “ third force ” in psychology , humanism is touted as a reaction both to the pessimistic determinism of psychoanalysis , with its emphasis on psychological disturbance , and to the behaviorists’ view of humans passively reacting to the environment , which has been criticized as making people out to be personality - less robots .",1
1008,"It does not suggest that psychoanalytic , behaviorist , and other points of view are incorrect but argues that these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience , and fail to recognize the innate capacity for self - directed change and transforming personal experiences .",0
1009,Rogers further divided the self into two categories : the ideal self and the real self .,0
1010,The ideal self is the person that you would like to be ; the real self is the person you actually are .,1
1011,Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves .,0
1012,"What are some everyday ways we can improve our memory , including recall ?",0
1013,"To help make sure information goes from short - term memory to long - term memory , you can use memory - enhancing strategies .",1
1014,"Near Mecca , Saudi Arabia , a prophet named Muhammad received a revelation that became a cornerstone of the Islamic faith .",0
1015,"The Koran contained his message , affirming monotheism but identifying Christ not as God but as a prophet like Moses , Abraham , David , and Muhammad .",1
1016,"Following Muhammad ’s death in 632 , Islam spread by both conversion and military conquest across the Middle East and Asia Minor to India and northern Africa , crossing the Straits of Gibraltar into Spain in the year 711 ( [ link]).In the seventh and eighth centuries , Islam spread quickly across North Africa and into the Middle East .",0
1017,"Just to the east of Portugal , King Ferdinand of Aragon married Queen Isabella of Castile in 1469 , uniting two of the most powerful independent kingdoms on the Iberian peninsula and laying the foundation for the modern nation of Spain .",0
1018,"Isabella , motivated by strong religious zeal , was instrumental in beginning the Inquisition in 1480 , a brutal campaign to root out Jews and Muslims who had seemingly converted to Christianity but secretly continued to practice their faith , as well as other heretics .",1

1024,"Lake water constantly irrigated these chinampas , or “ floating gardens , ” which are still in use and can be seen today in Xochimilco , a district of Mexico City .",1
1025,"Elizabeth did sanction an early attempt at colonization in 1584 , when Sir Walter Raleigh , a favorite of the queen ’s , attempted to establish a colony at Roanoke , an island off the coast of present - day North Carolina . The colony was small , consisting of only 117 people , who suffered a poor relationship with the local Indians , the Croatans , and struggled to survive in their new land ( [ link ] ) .",1
1026,The Pilgrims differed from other Puritans in their insistence on separating from what they saw as the corrupt Church of England .,0
1027,"For this reason , Pilgrims are known as Separatists . Like Jamestown , Plymouth occupies an iconic place in American national memory .",0
1028,The tale of the 102 migrants who crossed the Atlantic aboard the Mayflower and their struggle for survival is a well - known narrative of the founding of the country .,0
1029,"Las Casas ’s writing about the Spaniards’ horrific treatment of Indians helped inspire the so - called Black Legend , the idea that the Spanish were bloodthirsty conquerors with no regard for human life .",1
1030,"Perhaps not surprisingly , those who held this view of the Spanish were Spain ’s imperial rivals .",0
1031,The 1500s and early 1600s also introduced the process of commodification to the New World .,0
1032,"American silver , tobacco , and other items , which were used by native peoples for ritual purposes , became European commodities with a monetary value that could be bought and sold .",1
1033,"Native peoples had no immunity to diseases from across the Atlantic , to which they had never been exposed .",0
1034,"European explorers unwittingly brought with them chickenpox , measles , mumps , and smallpox , which ravaged native peoples despite their attempts to treat the diseases , decimating some populations and wholly destroying others ( [ link ] ) .",0

1040,"To meet these labor demands , early Virginians relied on indentured servants .",0
1041,"An indenture is a labor contract that young , impoverished , and often illiterate Englishmen and occasionally Englishwomen signed in England , pledging to work for a number of years ( usually between five and seven ) growing tobacco in the Chesapeake colonies .",1

1067,"The British Constitution promised representation of the will of British subjects , and without such representation , even the indirect tax of the Sugar Act was considered a threat to the settlers’ rights as British subjects .",0
1068,"Furthermore , some American colonists felt the colonies were on equal political footing with Great Britain .",0
1069,"In early 1774 , leaders in Parliament responded with a set of four measures designed to punish Massachusetts , commonly known at the Coercive Acts .",1
1070,The Boston Port Act shut down Boston Harbor until the East India Company was repaid .,1
1071,"While these gentry were drafting their grievances during the Stamp Act Congress , other colonists showed their distaste for the new act by boycotting British goods and protesting in the streets .",0
1072,"Two groups , the Sons of Liberty and the Daughters of Liberty , led the popular resistance to the Stamp Act .",1
1073,"Both groups considered themselves British patriots defending their liberty , just as their forebears had done in the time of James II .",0
1074,"In Massachusetts in 1768 , Samuel Adams wrote a letter that became known as the Massachusetts Circular .",0
1075,"Sent by the Massachusetts House of Representatives to the other colonial legislatures , the letter laid out the unconstitutionality of taxation without representation and encouraged the other colonies to again protest the taxes by boycotting British goods .",1
1076,Gage ’s actions led to the formation of local rebel militias that were able to mobilize in a minute ’s time .,0
1077,"These minutemen , many of whom were veterans of the French and Indian War , played an important role in the war for independence .",0
1078,"In one instance , General Gage seized munitions in Cambridge and Charlestown , but when he arrived to do the same in Salem , his troops were met by a large crowd of minutemen and had to leave empty - handed .",0
1079,"In Virginia , the royal governor , Lord Dunmore , raised Loyalist forces to combat the rebel colonists and also tried to use the large slave population to put down the rebellion .",0
1080,"In November 1775 , he issued a decree , known as Dunmore ’s Proclamation , promising freedom to slaves and indentured servants of rebels who remained loyal to the king and who pledged to fight with the Loyalists against the insurgents .",1
1081,Dunmore ’s Proclamation exposed serious problems for both the Patriot cause and for the British .,0
1082,"In the summer of 1781 , Cornwallis moved his army to Yorktown , Virginia .",0
1083,"He expected the Royal Navy to transport his army to New York , where he thought he would join General Sir Henry Clinton .",0
1084,"Monarchy rests on the practice of dynastic succession , in which the monarch ’s child or other relative inherits the throne .",1
1085,Contested dynastic succession produced chronic conflict and warfare in Europe .,0
1086,Enlightenment political thought profoundly influenced Adams and other revolutionary leaders seeking to create viable republican governments .,0
1087,"The ideas of the French philosopher Montesquieu , who had advocated the separation of powers in government , guided Adams ’s thinking .",0
1088,"Responding to a request for advice on proper government from North Carolina , Adams wrote Thoughts on Government , which influenced many state legislatures .",0
1089,The number of representatives in the upper chamber would also be based on the state ’s population .,0
1090,"This proportional representation gave the more populous states , like Virginia , more political power .",0
1091,"The Virginia Plan also called for an executive branch and a judicial branch , both of which were absent under the Articles of Confederation .",1
1092,"Under the three - fifths compromise in the 1787 Constitution , each slave would be counted as three - fifths of a person , so that three - fifths of the slave population would be counted toward the overall state population .",1
1093,"Article 1 , Section 2 stipulated that “ Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several states .",0
1094,"Supporters of the 1787 Constitution , known as Federalists , made the case that a centralized republic provided the best solution for the future .",1
1095,"Those who opposed it , known as Anti - Federalists , argued that the Constitution would consolidate all power in a national government , robbing the states of the power to make their own decisions .",1
1096,"To them , the Constitution appeared to mimic the old corrupt and centralized British regime , under which a far - off government made the laws .",0
1097,The United States operated with a flurry of different notes from multiple state banks and no coherent regulation .,0
1098,"By proposing that the new national bank buy up large volumes of state bank notes and demanding their conversion into gold , Hamilton especially wanted to discipline those state banks that issued paper money irresponsibly .",0
1099,"To that end , he delivered his “ Report on a National Bank ” in December 1790 , proposing a Bank of the United States , an institution modeled on the Bank of England .",1
1100,"In 1793 , the revolutionary French government sent Edmond - Charles Genêt to the United States to negotiate an alliance with the U.S. government .",0
1101,France authorized Genêt to issue letters of marque — documents authorizing ships and their crews to engage in piracy — to allow him to arm captured British ships in American ports with U.S. soldiers .,1
1102,"Genêt arrived in Charleston , South Carolina , amid great Democratic - Republican fanfare .",0
1103,"The French foreign minister , Charles - Maurice de Talleyrand , sent emissaries who told the American envoys that the United States must repay all outstanding debts owed to France , lend France 32 million guilders ( Dutch currency ) , and pay a £ 50,000 bribe before any negotiations could take place .",1
1104,"News of the attempt to extract a bribe , known as the XYZ affair because the French emissaries were referred to as X , Y , and Z in letters that President Adams released to Congress , outraged the American public and turned public opinion decidedly against France ( [ link ] ) .",0
1105,"In the court of public opinion , Federalists appeared to have been correct in their interpretation of France , while the pro - French Democratic - Republicans had been misled .",0
1106,"During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , artisans — skilled , experienced craft workers — produced goods by hand .",1
1107,The production of shoes provides a good example .,0
1108,"The Land Law of 1800 further encouraged land sales in the Northwest Territory by reducing the minimum parcel size by half and enabling sales on credit , with the goal of stimulating settlement by ordinary farmers .",1
1109,The government created land offices to handle these sales and established them in the West within easy reach of prospective landowners .,0
1110,"They could thus purchase land directly from the government , at the price the government had set .",0
1111,"Whitney also worked on machine tools , devices that cut and shaped metal to make standardized , interchangeable parts for other mechanical devices like clocks and guns .",1
1112,Whitney ’s machine tools to manufacture parts for muskets enabled guns to be manufactured and repaired by people other than skilled gunsmiths .,0
1113,"The railroads with steam locomotives offered a new mode of transportation that fascinated citizens , buoying their optimistic view of the possibilities of technological progress .",0
1114,The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad was the first to begin service with a steam locomotive .,1
1115,Its inaugural train ran in 1831 on a track outside Albany and covered twelve miles in twenty - five minutes .,0
1116,"However , as Federalist ideals fell out of favor , ordinary men from the middle and lower classes increasingly questioned the idea that property ownership was an indication of virtue .",0
1117,"They argued for universal manhood suffrage , or voting rights for all white male adults .",1
1118,So too did the appointment of Clay as secretary of state .,0
1119,John C. Calhoun labeled the whole affair a “ corrupt bargain ” ( [ link ] ) .,0
1120,"Everywhere , Jackson supporters vowed revenge against the anti - majoritarian result of 1824 .",0
1121,"Amid revelations of widespread fraud , including the disclosure that some $ 300,000 was missing from the Treasury Department , Jackson removed almost 50 percent of appointed civil officers , which allowed him to handpick their replacements .",0
1122,This replacement of appointed federal officials is called rotation in office .,1
1123,"Lucrative posts , such as postmaster and deputy postmaster , went to party loyalists , especially in places where Jackson ’s support had been weakest , such as New England .",0
1124,"Some southerners feared the federal government would next take additional action against the South , including the abolition of slavery .",0
1125,"The theory of nullification , or the voiding of unwelcome federal laws , provided wealthy slaveholders , who were a minority in the United States , with an argument for resisting the national government if it acted contrary to their interests .",1
1126,"James Hamilton , who served as governor of South Carolina in the early 1830s , denounced the “ despotic majority that oppresses us . ” Nullification also raised the specter of secession ; aggrieved states at the mercy of an aggressive majority would be forced to leave the Union .",1
1127,"This message referred directly to the situation in Georgia , Mississippi , and Alabama , where the Creek , Choctaw , Chickasaw , Seminole , and Cherokee peoples stood as obstacles to white settlement .",1
1128,"These groups were known as the Five Civilized Tribes , because they had largely adopted Anglo - American culture , speaking English and practicing Christianity .",0
1129,Some held slaves like their white counterparts .,0
1130,"A great deal of the social revolution of democracy , however , carried negative consequences .",0
1131,"Indeed , Tocqueville described a new type of tyranny , the tyranny of the majority , which overpowers the will of minorities and individuals and was , in his view , unleashed by democracy in the United States .",1
1132,For centuries Europeans had mistakenly believed an all - water route across the North American continent existed .,1
1133,This “ Northwest Passage ” would afford the country that controlled it not only access to the interior of North America but also — more importantly — a relatively quick route to the Pacific Ocean and to trade with Asia .,0
1134,"The Spanish , French , and British searched for years before American explorers took up the challenge of finding it .",0
1135,"Northern representatives supported the Tallmadge Amendment , denouncing slavery as immoral and opposed to the nation ’s founding principles of equality and liberty .",1
1136,Southerners in Congress rejected the amendment as an attempt to gradually abolish slavery — not just in Missouri but throughout the Union — by violating the property rights of slaveholders and their freedom to take their property wherever they wished .,0
1137,"Texas was sparsely settled , and the few Mexican farmers and ranchers who lived there were under constant threat of attack by hostile Indian tribes , especially the Comanche , who supplemented their hunting with raids in pursuit of horses and cattle . To increase the non - Indian population in Texas and provide a buffer zone between its hostile tribes and the rest of Mexico , Spain began to recruit empresarios .",0
1138,An empresario was someone who brought settlers to the region in exchange for generous grants of land .,1
1139,"Moses Austin , a once - prosperous entrepreneur reduced to poverty by the Panic of 1819 , requested permission to settle three hundred English - speaking American residents in Texas .",0
1140,"Accustomed to representative democracy , jury trials , and the defendant ’s right to appear before a judge , the Anglo - American settlers in Texas also disliked the Mexican legal system , which provided for an initial hearing by an alcalde , an administrator who often combined the duties of mayor , judge , and law enforcement officer .",1
1141,"The alcalde sent a written record of the proceeding to a judge in Saltillo , the state capital , who decided the outcome .",0
1142,"The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , signed in February 1848 , was a triumph for American expansionism under which Mexico ceded nearly half its land to the United States .",0
1143,"The Mexican Cession , as the conquest of land west of the Rio Grande was called , included the current states of California , New Mexico , Arizona , Nevada , Utah , and portions of Colorado and Wyoming .",1
1144,Mexico also recognized the Rio Grande as the border with the United States .,0
1145,"Committed to protecting white workers by keeping slavery out of the lands taken from Mexico , Pennsylvania congressman David Wilmot attached to an 1846 revenue bill an amendment that would prohibit slavery in the new territory .",1
1146,The Wilmot Proviso was not entirely new .,0
1147,"Other congressmen had drafted similar legislation , and Wilmot ’s language was largely copied from the 1787 Northwest Ordinance that had banned slavery in that territory .",0
1148,"Disgusted by the result , the Barnburners united with antislavery Whigs and former members of the Liberty Party to form a new political party — the Free - Soil Party , which took as its slogan “ Free Soil , Free Speech , Free Labor , and Free Men . ” The party had one real goal — to oppose the extension of slavery into the territories ( [ link ] ) .",1
1149,"In the minds of its members and many other northerners of the time , southern slaveholders had marshaled their wealth and power to control national politics for the purpose of protecting the institution of slavery and extending it into the territories .",0
1150,"In the antebellum era — that is , in the years before the Civil War — American planters in the South continued to grow Chesapeake tobacco and Carolina rice as they had in the colonial era .",1
1151,"Cotton , however , emerged as the antebellum South ’s major commercial crop , eclipsing tobacco , rice , and sugar in economic importance .",1
1152,Some slaveholders responded to this situation by freeing slaves ; far more decided to sell their excess bondsmen .,0
1153,"Virginia and Maryland therefore took the lead in the domestic slave trade , the trading of slaves within the borders of the United States .",1
1154,"Calhoun became a leading political theorist defending slavery and the rights of the South , which he saw as containing an increasingly embattled minority .",0
1155,"He advanced the idea of a concurrent majority , a majority of a separate region ( that would otherwise be in the minority of the nation ) with the power to veto or disallow legislation put forward by a hostile majority .",1
1156,"Missionaries and circuit riders ( ministers without a fixed congregation ) brought the message of the awakening across the United States , including into the lives of slaves .",1
1157,The revival spurred many slaveholders to begin encouraging their slaves to become Christians .,0
1158,"In 1805 , a second German religious society , led by George Rapp , took root in Pennsylvania with several hundred members called Rappites who encouraged celibacy and adhered to the socialist principle of holding all goods in common ( as opposed to allowing individual ownership ) .",0
1159,They not only built the town of Harmony but also produced surplus goods to sell to the outside world .,0
1160,"Graham advocated baths and cleanliness in general to preserve health ; hydropathy , or water cures for various ailments , became popular in the United States in the 1840s and 1850s .",1
1161,He also viewed masturbation and excessive sex as a cause of disease and debility .,0
1162,William Lloyd Garrison of Massachusetts distinguished himself as the leader of the abolitionist movement .,0
1163,"Although he had once been in favor of colonization , he came to believe that such a scheme only deepened racism and perpetuated the sinful practices of his fellow Americans .",0
1164,"In 1848 , about three hundred male and female feminists , many of them veterans of the abolition campaign , gathered at the Seneca Falls Convention in New York for a conference on women ’s rights that was organized by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton .",0
1165,It was the first of what became annual meetings that have continued to the present day .,0
1166,"Most stayed in the South , hiding in plain sight among free blacks in urban areas .",0
1167,"Nonetheless , southerners feared the influence of a vast Underground Railroad : the network of northern whites and free blacks who sympathized with runaway slaves and provided safe houses and safe passage from the South .",1
1168,"Quakers , who had long been troubled by slavery , were especially active in this network .",0
1169,"In 1857 , several months after President Buchanan took the oath of office , the Supreme Court ruled in Dred Scott v. Sandford .",0
1170,"Dred Scott ( [ link ] ) , born a slave in Virginia in 1795 , had been one of the thousands forced to relocate as a result of the massive internal slave trade and taken to Missouri , where slavery had been adopted as part of the Missouri Compromise .",0
1171,Southern leaders were divided on how to respond to Republican success .,0
1172,"Southern extremists , known as “ Fire - Eaters , ” openly called for secession .",1
1173,"Others , like Mississippi senator Jefferson Davis , put forward a more moderate approach by demanding constitutional protection of slavery .",0
1174,"In this way , states could protect themselves , and slavery , from interference by what they perceived to be an overbearing central government .",0
1175,"The constitution of the Confederate States of America ( CSA ) , or the Confederacy , drafted at a convention in Montgomery , Alabama , in February 1861 , closely followed the 1787 Constitution .",0
1176,The only real difference between the two documents centered on slavery .,0
1177,"General George B. McClellan , the general in chief of the army , responsible for overall control of Union land forces , proved especially reluctant to engage in battle with the Confederates .",0
1178,"In direct command of the Army of the Potomac , the Union fighting force operating outside Washington , DC , McClellan believed , incorrectly , that Confederate forces were too strong to defeat and was reluctant to risk his troops in battle .",0
1179,"General Ulysses S. Grant ’s Army of the West , operating in Kentucky , Tennessee , and the Mississippi River Valley , had been more successful .",0
1180,"In the western campaign , the goal of both the Union and the Confederacy was to gain control of the major rivers in the west , especially the Mississippi .",0
1181,"The Republican emphasis on free labor , rather than slave labor , also influenced the 1862 Land Grant College Act , commonly known as the Morrill Act after its author , Vermont Republican senator Justin Smith Morrill .",0
1182,"The measure provided for the creation of agricultural colleges , funded through federal grants , to teach the latest agricultural techniques .",1
1183,"On January 1 , 1863 , Lincoln made good on his promise and signed the Emancipation Proclamation .",0
1184,"It stated “ That on the first day of January , in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty - three , all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State , the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States , shall be then , thenceforward , and forever free . ” The proclamation did not immediately free the slaves in the Confederate states .",1
1185,"Many whites in the North found this deeply offensive , since they still believed in racial inequality .",0
1186,The 1863 New York City Draft Riots illustrated the depth of white anger .,0
1187,"From the outset of the rebellion in 1861 , Lincoln ’s overriding goal had been to bring the Southern states quickly back into the fold in order to restore the Union ( [ link ] ) .",0
1188,"In early December 1863 , the president began the process of reunification by unveiling a three - part proposal known as the ten percent plan that outlined how the states would return .",0
1189,"The ten percent plan gave a general pardon to all Southerners except high - ranking Confederate government and military leaders ; required 10 percent of the 1860 voting population in the former rebel states to take a binding oath of future allegiance to the United States and the emancipation of slaves ; and declared that once those voters took those oaths , the restored Confederate states would draft new state constitutions .",1
1190,"It was important for them to show that the party supported all loyal men , regardless of their origin or political persuasion .",0
1191,"Johnson appeared an ideal choice , because his nomination would bring with it the support of both pro - Southern elements and the War Democrats who rejected the conciliatory stance of the Copperheads , the northern Democrats who opposed the Civil War .",0
1192,"In 1865 and 1866 , as Johnson announced the end of Reconstruction , southern states began to pass a series of discriminatory state laws collectively known as black codes .",1
1193,"While the laws varied in both content and severity from state to state , the goal of the laws remained largely consistent .",0
1194,"More dispiriting still was the fact that many women ’s rights activists , such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton , had played a large part in the abolitionist movement leading up to the Civil War .",0
1195,"Following the war , women and men , white and black , formed the American Equal Rights Association ( AERA ) for the expressed purpose of securing “ equal Rights to all American citizens , especially the right of suffrage , irrespective of race , color or sex . ” Two years later , with the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , section 2 of which specifically qualified the liberties it extended to “ male citizens , ” it seemed as though the progress made in support of civil rights was not only passing women by but was purposely codifying their exclusion .",1
1196,"As Congress debated the language of the Fifteenth Amendment , some held out hope that it would finally extend the franchise to women .",0
1197,"Throughout the South , sharecropping took root , a crop - lien system that worked to the advantage of landowners .",1
1198,"Under the system , freed people rented the land they worked , often on the same plantations where they had been slaves .",0
1199,"In what became known as the Compromise of 1877 , Republican Senate leaders worked with the Democratic leadership so they would support Hayes and the commission ’s decision .",0
1200,"The two sides agreed that one Southern Democrat would be appointed to Hayes ’s cabinet , Democrats would control federal patronage ( the awarding of government jobs ) in their areas in the South , and there would be a commitment to generous internal improvements , including federal aid for the Texas and Pacific Railway .",1
1201,"In addition to a significant European migration westward , several thousand African Americans migrated west following the Civil War , as much to escape the racism and violence of the Old South as to find new economic opportunities .",1
1202,"They were known as exodusters , referencing the biblical flight from Egypt , because they fled the racism of the South , with most of them headed to Kansas from Kentucky , Tennessee , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Texas .",0
1203,Over twenty - five thousand exodusters arrived in Kansas in 1879–1880 alone .,0
1204,The search for gold represented an opportunity far different from the slow plod that homesteading farmers faced .,0
1205,"The discovery of gold at Sutter ’s Mill in Coloma , California , set a pattern for such strikes that was repeated again and again for the next decade , in what collectively became known as the California Gold Rush .",1
1206,"In what became typical , a sudden disorderly rush of prospectors descended upon a new discovery site , followed by the arrival of those who hoped to benefit from the strike by preying off the newly rich .",0
1207,"One of the more vicious examples was near Sand Creek , Colorado , where Colonel John Chivington led a militia raid upon a camp in which the leader had already negotiated a peaceful settlement .",1
1208,"The camp was flying both the American flag and the white flag of surrender when Chivington ’s troops murdered close to one hundred people , the majority of them women and children , in what became known as the Sand Creek Massacre .",0
1209,"For the rest of his life , Chivington would proudly display his collection of nearly one hundred Indian scalps from that day .",0
1210,"In a few instances , frustrated Hispanic citizens fought back against the white settlers who dispossessed them of their belongings .",0
1211,"In 1889–1890 in New Mexico , several hundred Mexican Americans formed las Gorras Blancas ( the White Caps ) to try and reclaim their land and intimidate white Americans , preventing further land seizures .",0
1212,"White Caps conducted raids of white farms , burning homes , barns , and crops to express their growing anger and frustration .",0
1213,"The exploitation of these new technologies provided opportunities for tremendous growth , and business entrepreneurs with financial backing and the right mix of business acumen and ambition could make their fortunes .",0
1214,"Some of these new millionaires were known in their day as robber barons , a negative term that connoted the belief that they exploited workers and bent laws to succeed .",1
1215,"Regardless of how they were perceived , these businessmen and the companies they created revolutionized American industry .",0
1216,"He hounded those who refused to sell out to him , until they were driven out of business .",0
1217,Through his method of growth via mergers and acquisitions of similar companies — known as horizontal integration —Standard Oil grew to include almost all refineries in the area .,1
1218,"By 1879 , the Standard Oil Company controlled nearly 95 percent of all oil refining businesses in the country , as well as 90 percent of all the refining businesses in the world .",0
1219,"In one night , however , the KOL ’s popularity — and indeed the momentum of the labor movement as a whole — plummeted due to an event known as the Haymarket affair , which occurred on May 4 , 1886 , in Chicago ’s Haymarket Square ( [ link ] ) .",0
1220,"There , an anarchist group had gathered in response to a death at an earlier nationwide demonstration for the eight - hour workday .",1
1221,"In the secular sphere , the settlement house movement of the 1890s provided additional relief .",0
1222,"Pioneering women such as Jane Addams in Chicago and Lillian Wald in New York led this early progressive reform movement in the United States , building upon ideas originally fashioned by social reformers in England .",0
1223,"Those middle - class and wealthier urbanites who enjoyed the costlier amenities presented by city life — including theaters , restaurants , and shopping — were free to escape to the suburbs , leaving behind the poorer working classes living in squalor and unsanitary conditions .",0
1224,"Through the City Beautiful movement , leaders such as Frederick Law Olmsted and Daniel Burnham sought to champion middle- and upper - class progressive reforms .",0
1225,"They improved the quality of life for city dwellers , but also cultivated middle - class - dominated urban spaces in which Americans of different ethnicities , racial origins , and classes worked and lived .",0
1226,"Other thinkers of the day took Charles Darwin ’s theories in a more nuanced direction , focusing on different theories of realism that sought to understand the truth underlying the changes in the United States .",0
1227,t does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines ?,0
1228,"Science ( from the Latin scientia , meaning “ knowledge ” ) can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws , especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method .",1
1229,It becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science .,0
1230,ypothesis may become a verified theory .,0
1231,A theory is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena .,1
1232,Science may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe .,1
1233,valid hypothesis must be testable .,0
1234,"It should also be falsifiable , meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results .",0
1235,"Importantly , science does not claim to “ prove ” anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further information .",0
1236,sic science or “ pure ” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short - term application of that knowledge .,0
1237,It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value .,0
1238,"stead , most scientists present their results in peer - reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals .",0
1239,"Peer - reviewed manuscripts are scientific papers that are reviewed by a scientist ’s colleagues , or peers .",1
1240,"These colleagues are qualified individuals , often experts in the same research area , who judge whether or not the scientist ’s work is suitable for publication .",0
1241,e introduction refers to the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following the style of the journal .,0
1242,Using the work or ideas of others without proper citation is considered plagiarism .,1
1243,"e results are presented by means of tables or graphs , but no duplicate information should be presented .",0
1244,"In the discussion section , the researcher will interpret the results , describe how variables may be related , and attempt to explain the observations .",0
1245,It is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific research .,0
1246,"ese conditions may , however , change from one moment to the next .",0
1247,"Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly , despite environmental changes , through homeostasis ( literally , “ steady state”)—the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions .",1
1248,"For example , an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation .",0
1249,molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds .,1
1250,"Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization ( a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers , which are simpler than macromolecules ) .",1
1251,"An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( [ link ] ) , which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms .",1
1252,lls are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic .,0
1253,"Prokaryotes are single - celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane - bound nuclei ; in contrast , the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane - bound organelles and a membrane - bound nucleus .",1
1254,gans are present not only in animals but also in plants .,0
1255,An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs .,1
1256,Mammals have many organ systems .,0
1257,"r example , the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations .",0
1258,A community is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area .,0
1259,"For instance , all of the trees , flowers , insects , and other populations in a forest form the forest ’s community .",0
1260,"e fact that biology , as a science , has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on earth .",0
1261,"The source of this diversity is evolution , the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species .",0
1262,Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems .,0
1263,"r instance , molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level , including interactions among molecules such as DNA , RNA , and proteins , as well as the way they are regulated .",0
1264,"Microbiology , the study of microorganisms , is the study of the structure and function of single - celled organisms .",0
1265,"It is quite a broad branch itself , and depending on the subject of study , there are also microbial physiologists , ecologists , and geneticists , among others .",0
1266,"leontology , another branch of biology , uses fossils to study life ’s history ( [ link ] ) .",0
1267,"Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants , respectively .",0
1268,"Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists , ecologists , or physiologists , to name just a few areas .",0
1269," understand how elements come together , we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element , the atom .",0
1270,An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element .,0
1271,"For example , one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature .",0
1272,"erefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge .",0
1273,"Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons , weighing only 9.11 × 10 - 28 grams , or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit .",0
1274,"Hence , they do not contribute much to an element ’s overall atomic mass .",0
1275,is approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number .,0
1276,"Since an element ’s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers , scientists also determine the atomic mass , which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes .",0
1277,"Often , the resulting number contains a fraction .",0
1278,e different elements are organized and displayed in the periodic table .,0
1279,"Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev ( 1834–1907 ) in 1869 , the table groups elements that , although unique , share certain chemical properties with other elements .",0
1280, early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr ( 1885–1962 ) .,0
1281,"The Bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons , with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from the nucleus , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
1282,"These orbits form electron shells or energy levels , which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells .",0
1283,"drogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration , while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable .",0
1284,"As a result of losing a negatively charged electron , they become positively charged ions .",0
1285,"Group 17 elements , including fluorine and chlorine , have seven electrons in their outmost shells , so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules , making them negatively charged ions .",0
1286,is is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable .,0
1287,"However , since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells , atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration .",0
1288,"When two or more atoms chemically bond with each other , the resultant chemical structure is a molecule .",0
1289," the equation below , the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules .",0
1290,"This is an example of a balanced chemical equation , wherein the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the equation .",1
1291,"According to the law of conservation of matter , the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal , such that no atoms are , under normal circumstances , created or destroyed .",1
1292,e equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible .,0
1293,Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction .,0
1294,"In reversible reactions , reactants are turned into products , but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold ( characteristic of the particular reaction ) , some of these products will be converted back into reactants ; at this point , the designations of products and reactants are reversed .",0
1295,"cause the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons , each ion has a net charge .",0
1296,Cations are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons .,1
1297,Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions .,1
1298,nic bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges .,1
1299,"For instance , positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride , or table salt , creating a crystalline molecule with zero net charge .",0
1300,ere are two types of covalent bonds : polar and nonpolar .,0
1301,"In a polar covalent bond , shown in [ link ] , the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other .",1
1302,"Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements , a slightly positive ( δ+ ) or slightly negative ( δ– ) charge develops .",0
1303,"en this happens , a weak interaction occurs between the δ+of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ– charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule , usually oxygen or nitrogen , or within the same molecule .",1
1304,This interaction is called a hydrogen bond .,0
1305,This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules .,0
1306," contrast , non - polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than dissolve in it , as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar ( an acidic water solution ) .",1
1307,These nonpolar compounds are called hydrophobic ( hydro- = “ water ” ; -phobic = “ fearing ” ) .,0
1308,"ter also has a high heat of vaporization , the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas .",1
1309,A considerable amount of heat energy ( 586 cal ) is required to accomplish this change in water .,0
1310,"e charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules .",1
1311,"This is referred to as a sphere of hydration , or a hydration shell , as illustrated in [ link ] and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water . When ionic compounds are added to water , the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation .",0
1312,Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions .,1
1313,"ese cohesive forces are related to water ’s property of adhesion , or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules .",1
1314,"This attraction is sometimes stronger than water ’s cohesive forces , especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes .",0
1315,"sing the negative logarithm to generate positive integers , high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number , whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH .",0
1316,"An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions ( H+ ) in a solution , usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate .",1
1317,"A base provides either hydroxide ions ( OH– ) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions , reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH .",1
1318,uffers are the key .,0
1319,"Buffers readily absorb excess H+ or OH– , keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival .",1
1320,Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person ’s well - being .,0
1321,"o far , the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons , which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms .",1
1322,"Another type of hydrocarbon , aromatic hydrocarbons , consists of closed rings of carbon atoms .",1
1323,olecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers .,1
1324,"Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties .",1
1325,"For example , due to their different chemical properties , butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches , whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans . Geometric isomers , on the other hand , have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms , especially in carbon - to - carbon double bonds .",1
1326,unctional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules .,1
1327,They are found along the “ carbon backbone ” of macromolecules .,0
1328,"ost macromolecules are made from single subunits , or building blocks , called monomers .",1
1329,The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers .,1
1330,"ehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed , or “ sped up , ” by specific enzymes ; dehydration reactions involve the formation of new bonds , requiring energy , while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy .",1
1331,"These reactions are similar for most macromolecules , but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class .",0
1332,"onosaccharides ( mono- = “ one ” ; sacchar- = “ sweet ” ) are simple sugars , the most common of which is glucose .",1
1333,"In monosaccharides , the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven .",0
1334,olysaccharidesA long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide ( poly- = “ many ” ) .,1
1335,"The chain may be branched or unbranched , and it may contain different types of monosaccharides .",0
1336,"rthropods ( insects , crustaceans , and others ) have an outer skeleton , called the exoskeleton , which protects their internal body parts ( as seen in the bee in [ link ] ) . This exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin , which is a polysaccharide - containing nitrogen .",1
1337,"It is made of repeating units of N - acetyl - β - d - glucosamine , a modified sugar .",0
1338,ome fatty acids have common names that specify their origin .,0
1339,"For example , palmitic acid , a saturated fatty acid , is derived from the palm tree .",1
1340,"Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea , the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts .",1
1341,"onsequently , they have to be supplemented through ingestion via the diet .",0
1342,Omega-3 fatty acids ( like that shown in [ link ] ) fall into this category and are one of only two known for humans ( the other being omega-6 fatty acid ) .,0
1343,These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are called omega-3 because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon by a double bond .,0
1344,"nlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier , steroids have a fused ring structure .",0
1345,"Although they do not resemble the other lipids , they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic and insoluble in water .",0
1346,"ormones are chemical - signaling molecules , usually small proteins or steroids , secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes , including growth , development , metabolism , and reproduction .",1
1347,"For example , insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level .",0
1348,"he sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein 's shape , size , and function .",0
1349,"Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond , known as a peptide bond , which is formed by a dehydration reaction .",1
1350,"The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine , releasing a molecule of water .",0
1351,he local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein .,0
1352,The most common are the α - helix and β - pleated sheet structures ( [ link ] ) .,0
1353,Both structures are the α - helix structure — the helix held in shape by hydrogen bonds .,1
1354,t was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process .,0
1355,Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones ( or chaperonins ) that associate with the target protein during the folding process .,1
1356,"They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure , and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded .",0
1357,he DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell .,1
1358,This intermediary is the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) .,0
1359,"Other types of RNA — like rRNA , tRNA , and microRNA — are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation .",0
1360,denine and guanine are classified as purines .,0
1361,The primary structure of a purine is two carbon - nitrogen rings .,0
1362,"n this way , the mRNA is read and the protein product is made .",0
1363,Ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mRNA binds .,1
1364,The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes ; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity ( peptidyl transferase ) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids .,0
1365,"ith few exceptions , individual cells can not be seen with the naked eye , so scientists use microscopes ( micro- = “ small ” ; -scope = “ to look at ” ) to study them .",0
1366,A microscope is an instrument that magnifies an object .,1
1367,"Most photographs of cells are taken with a microscope , and these images can also be called micrographs . The optics of a microscope ’s lenses change the orientation of the image that the user sees .",1
1368,"y the late 1830s , botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the unified cell theory , which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells , the cell is the basic unit of life , and new cells arise from existing cells .",1
1369,Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this theory .,0
1370,"ur natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function , especially in cell biology , and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells ( [ link ] ) .",0
1371,"Unlike prokaryotic cells , eukaryotic cells have : 1 ) a membrane - bound nucleus ; 2 ) numerous membrane - bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus , chloroplasts , mitochondria , and others ; and 3 ) several , rod - shaped chromosomes .",1
1372,"Because a eukaryotic cell ’s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane , it is often said to have a “ true nucleus . ” The word “ organelle ” means “ little organ , ” and , as already mentioned , organelles have specialized cellular functions , just as the organs of your body have specialized functions . At this point , it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells .",1
1373,he cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope ( a structure to be discussed shortly ) .,1
1374,"It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel - like cytosol , the cytoskeleton , and various chemicals ( [ link ] ) .",0
1375,"Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water , it has a semi - solid consistency , which comes from the proteins within it .",0
1376,"he nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions , molecules , and RNA between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm .",1
1377,"The nucleoplasm is the semi - solid fluid inside the nucleus , where we find the chromatin and the nucleolus .",1
1378,ome chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA .,0
1379,A darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus ( plural = nucleoli ) aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm .,1
1380,"eroxisomes are small , round organelles enclosed by single membranes .",1
1381,They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids .,0
1382,nimal cells have another set of organelles not found in plant cells : lysosomes .,0
1383,"The lysosomes are the cell ’s “ garbage disposal . ” In plant cells , the digestive processes take place in vacuoles .",1
1384,"Enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of proteins , polysaccharides , lipids , nucleic acids , and even worn - out organelles .",0

1389,"o refresh your memory , flagella ( singular = flagellum ) are long , hair - like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell ( for example , sperm , Euglena ) .",1
1390,"When present , the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella .",0
1391,uch transport uses the vascular tissues ( xylem and phloem ) primarily .,0
1392,"There also exist structural modifications called plasmodesmata ( singular = plasmodesma ) , numerous channels that pass between cell walls of adjacent plant cells , connect their cytoplasm , and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell , and thus throughout the plant ( [ link]).A plasmodesma is a channel between the cell walls of two adjacent plant cells .",1
1393,Plasmodesmata allow materials to pass from the cytoplasm of one plant cell to the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell .,0
1394,"ap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions , nutrients , and other substances that enable cells to communicate ( [ link ] ) .",1
1395,"Structurally , however , gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ .",0
1396,"he main fabric of the membrane is composed of amphiphilic , phospholipid molecules .",0
1397,The hydrophilic or “ water - loving ” areas of these molecules ( which look like a collection of balls in an artist ’s rendition of the model ) ( [ link ] ) are in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell .,1

1400,"Integral proteins ( some specialized types are called integrins ) are , as their name suggests , integrated completely into the membrane structure , and their hydrophobic membrane - spanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the the phospholipid bilayer ( [ link ] ) .",1
1401,Single - pass integral membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of 20–25 amino acids .,0
1402,he most direct forms of membrane transport are passive .,0
1403,Passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement .,1
1404,"In passive transport , substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration .",0
1405,"n filtration , material moves according to its concentration gradient through a membrane ; sometimes the rate of diffusion is enhanced by pressure , causing the substances to filter more rapidly .",1
1406,"This occurs in the kidney , where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances , or solutes , out of the blood and into the renal tubules .",1
1407,The rate of diffusion in this instance is almost totally dependent on pressure .,0
1408,hannels are specific for the substance that is being transported .,0
1409,Channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids ; they additionally have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers ( [ link ] ) .,1
1410,Passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell .,0
1411,"smosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane , which is inversely proportional to the concentration of solutes .",1
1412,"While diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells , osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water .",0
1413, solution 's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution .,0
1414,Osmolarity describes the total solute concentration of the solution .,1
1415,A solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles ; a solution with high osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles .,0
1416,"n an isotonic solution , the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell .",1
1417,"If the osmolarity of the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid , there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell , although water will still move in and out .",0
1418,"he electrical gradient of K+ , a positive ion , also tends to drive it into the cell , but the concentration gradient of K+ tends to drive K+ out of the cell ( [ link ] ) .",0
1419,The combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its electrochemical gradient .,1
1420,"rimary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on ATP .",1
1421,Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP .,1
1422, uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule .,1
1423,"A symporter carries two different ions or molecules , both in the same direction .",1
1424,"An antiporter also carries two different ions or molecules , but in different directions .",1
1425,"ndocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles , such as large molecules , parts of cells , and even whole cells , into a cell .",1
1426,"There are different variations of endocytosis , but all share a common characteristic : The plasma membrane of the cell invaginates , forming a pocket around the target particle .",0
1427, variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis .,0
1428,"This process uses a coating protein , called caveolin , on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane , which performs a similar function to clathrin .",1

1431,Waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane .,0
1432,nabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones .,1
1433,Synthesizing sugar from CO2 is one example .,0
1434,"n most cases , this form is heat energy .",0
1435,"Thermodynamically , heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not doing work .",1
1436,"For example , when an airplane flies through the air , some of the energy of the flying plane is lost as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air .",0
1437,"f it is released , indeed it would do work .",0
1438,"Because this type of energy refers to the potential to do work , it is called potential energy .",0

1448,"wo reactants might also enter a reaction , both become modified , and leave the reaction as two products .",0
1449,The location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme ’s active site .,1
1450,"The active site is where the “ action ” happens , so to speak .",0
1451,"n some cases of enzyme inhibition , for example , an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding .",0
1452,"When this happens , the enzyme is inhibited through competitive inhibition , because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for active site binding ( [ link ] ) .",1
1453,"On the other hand , in noncompetitive inhibition , an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than an allosteric site and still manages to block substrate binding to the active site .",1
1454,"n a most efficient and elegant way , cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity .",0
1455,Feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further production ( [ link ] ) .,1

1468,he endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( [ link ] ) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids .,1
1469,"However , these two functions are performed in separate areas of the ER : the rough ER and the smooth ER , respectively .",0
1470,"efore reaching their final destination , the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need to be sorted , packaged , and tagged so that they wind up in the right place .",0

1500,"In contrast to ADH , which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain proper water balance , aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion from extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules .",1
1501,"Because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the concentrations of minerals Na+ and K+ , aldosterone is referred to as a mineralocorticoid , a corticosteroid that affects ion and water balance .",1
1502,"Aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels , blood volume , or blood pressure , or an increase in blood potassium levels .",0
1503,"During puberty in both males and females , the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) , which stimulates the production and release of follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary gland .",1
1504,These hormones regulate the gonads ( testes in males and ovaries in females ) and therefore are called gonadotropins .,1
1505,"In both males and females , FSH stimulates gamete production and LH stimulates production of hormones by the gonads .",0
1506,Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth .,1
1507,"Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin - releasing hormone ( PRH ) and prolactin - inhibiting hormone ( PIH ) , which is now known to be dopamine .",0
1508,"PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it . The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin , which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth .",0
1509,"Impaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus , the main symptoms of which are illustrated in [ link ] .",1
1510,"This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas , or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin .",0
1511,"The basal metabolic rate , which is the amount of calories required by the body at rest , is determined by two hormones produced by the thyroid gland : thyroxine , also known as tetraiodothyronine or T4 , and triiodothyronine , also known as T3 .",1
1512,"These hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain , uterus , testes , blood cells , and spleen .",0
1513,"Inadequate iodine intake , which occurs in many developing countries , results in an inability to synthesize T3 and T4 hormones .",0
1514,"The thyroid gland enlarges in a condition called goiter , which is caused by overproduction of TSH without the formation of thyroid hormone .",1
1515,"Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid , and TSH stimulation results in higher levels of colloid accumulation in the thyroid .",0
1516,"Blood calcium levels are regulated by parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , which is produced by the parathyroid glands , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
1517,PTH is released in response to low blood Ca2 + levels .,0
1518,This results in a switch by most tissues from utilizing glucose as an energy source to utilizing fatty acids .,1
1519,This process is called a glucose - sparing effect .,0
1520,"In another direct mechanism , GH stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver ; the glycogen is then released into the blood as glucose .",0
1521,A balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development .,0
1522,"Underproduction of GH in adults does not appear to cause any abnormalities , but in children it can result in pituitary dwarfism , in which growth is reduced .",1
1523,Pituitary dwarfism is characterized by symmetric body formation .,0
1524,The sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus .,0
1525,"Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla ( which mediates short - term stress responses ) via nerve impulses , and the adrenal cortex , which mediates long - term stress responses , via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary . Short - term Stress ResponseWhen presented with a stressful situation , the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy .",1
1526,The hormones epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( also known as noradrenaline ) are released by the adrenal medulla .,0
1527,They change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism .,0
1528,"There are two main corticosteroids : glucocorticoids such as cortisol , and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone .",0
1529,These hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue .,0
1530,"This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck , and excessive glucose in the blood .",0
1531,"Hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause Addison ’s disease , which may result in bronzing of the skin , hypoglycemia , and low electrolyte levels in the blood .",1
1532,The bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain .,0
1533,"The skull consists of 22 bones , which are divided into two categories : cranial bones and facial bones .",0
1534,"The auditory ossicles consist of three bones each : the malleus , incus , and stapes .",0
1535,"These are the smallest bones in the body and are unique to mammals . Fourteen facial bones form the face , provide cavities for the sense organs ( eyes , mouth , and nose ) , protect the entrances to the digestive and respiratory tracts , and serve as attachment points for facial muscles .",1
1536,"The 14 facial bones are the nasal bones , the maxillary bones , zygomatic bones , palatine , vomer , lacrimal bones , the inferior nasal conchae , and the mandible .",0
1537,Intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum .,1
1538,Each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from movements such as walking and running .,0
1539,It is formed from three bones that fuse in the adult .,0
1540,"The ribs are 12 pairs of long , curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body , forming the ribcage .",1
1541,"Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum , with the exception of rib pairs 11 and 12 , which are free - floating ribs .",1
1542,The clavicles are S - shaped bones that position the arms on the body .,1
1543,The clavicles lie horizontally across the front of the thorax ( chest ) just above the first rib .,0
1544,An articulation is any place at which two bones are joined .,1
1545,The humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb and the only bone of the arm .,1
1546,It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow .,0
1547,The radius is located along the lateral ( thumb ) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow .,1
1548,The ulna is located on the medial aspect ( pinky - finger side ) of the forearm .,1
1549,It is longer than the radius .,0
1550,The pelvic girdle is further strengthened by two large hip bones .,0
1551,"In adults , the hip bones , or coxal bones , are formed by the fusion of three pairs of bones : the ilium , ischium , and pubis .",1
1552,The pelvis joins together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the sacrum at the posterior of the body .,0
1553,"At the distal end , the femur , tibia , and patella form the knee joint .",1
1554,"The patella , or kneecap , is a triangular bone that lies anterior to the knee joint .",1
1555,The patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors ( quadriceps ) .,1
1556,The tarsals are the seven bones of the ankle .,1
1557,The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot .,1
1558,The amount of movement in these types of joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers .,0
1559,Gomphoses occur between teeth and their sockets ; the term refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg ( [ link ] ) .,1
1560,The tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue referred to as the periodontal ligament .,0
1561,Synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children .,1
1562,"In symphyses , hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage .",0
1563,Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae .,1
1564,"This includes sutures , gomphoses , and synchondroses .",0
1565,"Amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement , including syndesmoses and symphyses .",1
1566,"Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint , as in synovial joints .",1
1567,Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes .,1
1568,"There are several different types of angular movements , including flexion , extension , hyperextension , abduction , adduction , and circumduction .",0
1569,Movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction .,1
1570,"Circumduction is the movement of a limb in a circular motion , as in moving the arm in a circular motion .",1
1571,"Depression is the opposite of elevation — movement downward of a bone , such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position .",1
1572,Dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee .,1
1573,"Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted , such as when standing on the toes .",1
1574,Supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward .,1
1575,"Pronation is the opposite movement , in which the palm faces backward .",1
1576,"Opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand , making it possible to grasp and hold objects .",1
1577,"In hinge joints , the slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone .",1
1578,"In this way , one bone moves while the other remains stationary , like the hinge of a door .",0
1579,"Saddle joints are so named because the ends of each bone resemble a saddle , with concave and convex portions that fit together .",1
1580,Saddle joints allow angular movements similar to condyloid joints but with a greater range of motion .,0
1581,The striations are caused by the regular arrangement of contractile proteins ( actin and myosin ) .,0
1582,Actin is a globular contractile protein that interacts with myosin for muscle contraction .,1
1583,Skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei present in a single cell .,0
1584,"These cells are incredibly large , with diameters of up to 100 µm and lengths of up to 30 cm .",0
1585,The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called the sarcolemma .,1
1586,"The sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction , which triggers muscle contraction .",0
1587,Myofibrils are composed of smaller structures called myofilaments .,1
1588,There are two main types of filaments : thick filaments and thin filaments ; each has different compositions and locations .,0
1589,"To keep actin from binding to the active site on myosin , regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites .",0
1590,"Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules , preventing cross - bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input .",1
1591,Troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule ; it also binds calcium ions .,0
1592,ACh is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) into acetyl and choline .,0
1593,"AChE resides in the synaptic cleft , breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh receptors , which would cause unwanted extended muscle contraction ( [ link ] ) .",0
1594,Long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends .,1
1595,"The diaphysis , or central shaft , contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity .",0
1596,"Short bones , or cuboidal bones , are bones that are the same width and length , giving them a cube - like shape .",1
1597,"For example , the bones of the wrist ( carpals ) and ankle ( tarsals ) are short bones ( [ link ] ) .",0
1598,"Sesamoid bones are small , flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed .",1
1599,The patellae are sesamoid bones ( [ link ] ) .,0
1600,Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems .,0
1601,"Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi , which transport blood . They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone .",1
1602,"Whereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones , spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all bones .",0
1603,Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue .,1
1604,Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active osteocytes .,0
1605,Osteoclasts are large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei .,1
1606,They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve the bony matrix .,0
1607,"Ossification , or osteogenesis , is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts .",1
1608,"Ossification is distinct from the process of calcification ; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones , it can also occur in other tissues .",0
1609,Secondary ossification centers form in the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert hyaline cartilage into spongy bone .,0
1610,"Until adolescence , hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate ( growth plate ) , which is the region between the diaphysis and epiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones ( [ link ] ) .",1
1611,"In mammals , pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation ( breathing ) .",0
1612,"During inhalation , air enters the body through the nasal cavity located just inside the nose ( [ link ] ) .",1
1613,"As air passes through the nasal cavity , the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified .",0
1614,"In the lungs , air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages , or bronchi .",0
1615,Air enters the lungs through the two primary ( main ) bronchi ( singular : bronchus ) .,0
1616,"Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction ( parasympathetic ) or relaxation ( sympathetic ) in the bronchi and bronchioles , depending on the nervous system ’s cues .",0
1617,"In humans , bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the respiratory bronchioles .",1
1618,They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape .,0
1619,"In the acinar region , the alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole .",0
1620,"At the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs , each containing 20 to 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter .",1
1621,Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli .,0
1622,Partial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases .,1
1623,The total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture .,0
1624,"On average , this volume is around one - half liter , which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle .",0
1625,The expiratory reserve volume ( ERV ) is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .,1
1626,It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal .,0
1627,Capacities are measurements of two or more volumes .,0
1628,The vital capacity ( VC ) measures the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle .,1
1629,"It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .",0
1630,The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation .,1
1631,"Lastly , the total lung capacity ( TLC ) is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold .",1
1632,"It is the sum of the residual volume , expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .",0
1633,"In addition , the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled , is measured .",1
1634,"The ratio of these values ( FEV1/FVC ratio ) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma , emphysema , and fibrosis .",0
1635,"If the FEV1/FVC ratio is high , the lungs are not compliant ( meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly ) , and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis .",0
1636,The chest wall expands out and away from the lungs .,0
1637,"The lungs are elastic ; therefore , when air fills the lungs , the elastic recoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs .",0
1638,These outward and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath .,0
1639,"The space between these layers , the intrapleural space , contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax .",1
1640,Pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed ; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung .,1
1641,"There are two types of work conducted during respiration , flow - resistive and elastic work .",0
1642,"Flow - resistive refers to the work of the alveoli and tissues in the lung , whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles , chest wall , and diaphragm .",1
1643,Increasing the respiration rate increases the flow - resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles .,0
1644,Pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs .,0
1645,Two main causes of decreased gas exchange are compliance ( how elastic the lung is ) and resistance ( how much obstruction exists in the airways ) .,1
1646,A change in either can dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide .,0
1647,"Obstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema , asthma , and pulmonary edema .",0
1648,"In emphysema , which mostly arises from smoking tobacco , the walls of the alveoli are destroyed , decreasing the surface area for gas exchange .",1
1649,There are two types of V / Q mismatch .,0
1650,"Both produce dead space , regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue .",1
1651,"Dead spaces can severely impact breathing , because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion .",0
1652,"HemoglobinHemoglobin , or Hb , is a protein molecule found in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) made of four subunits : two alpha subunits and two beta subunits ( [ link ] ) .",1
1653,"Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule , allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules .",0
1654,Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red .,0
1655,"Increased temperature , such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle , causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced . Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood ’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen - carrying capacity .",0
1656,"In sickle cell anemia , the shape of the red blood cell is crescent - shaped , elongated , and stiffened , reducing its ability to deliver oxygen ( [ link ] ) .",1
1657,"In this form , red blood cells can not pass through the capillaries .",0
1658,"Third , the majority of carbon dioxide molecules ( 85 percent ) are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system .",0
1659,"In this system , carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells .",1
1660,"In all vertebrate organisms , as well as some invertebrates , this is a closed - loop system , in which the blood is not free in a cavity .",0
1661,"In a closed circulatory system , blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route , then returns to the heart again , as illustrated in [ link]a .",1
1662,"As opposed to a closed system , arthropods — including insects , crustaceans , and most mollusks — have an open circulatory system , as illustrated in [ link]b .",0
1663,As illustrated in [ link]a Fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two - chambered heart that has only a single atrium and a single ventricle .,0
1664,The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re - oxygenated ; this is called gill circulation .,1
1665,The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium ; this is called systemic circulation .,0
1666,"The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body , reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish . In amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals , blood flow is directed in two circuits : one through the lungs and back to the heart , which is called pulmonary circulation , and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain ( systemic circulation ) .",1
1667,"In amphibians , gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation .",0
1668,"The blood is more than the proteins , though .",0
1669,"Blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma ( the liquid portion , which contains water , proteins , salts , lipids , and glucose ) and the cells ( red and white cells ) and cell fragments called platelets .",1
1670,"Blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water , proteins , electrolytes , lipids , and glucose .",0
1671,The plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum .,1
1672,Serum is similar to interstitial fluid in which the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves .,0
1673,The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve .,1
1674,"After it is filled , the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries , by - passing the semilunar valve ( or pulmonic valve ) to the lungs for re - oxygenation .",0
1675,"After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries , the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle .",0
1676,The inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium .,0
1677,The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .,1
1678,"The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium , of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart ; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures .",1
1679,The coronary arteries branch from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown .,1
1680,They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be re - oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit .,0
1681,The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood .,0
1682,The main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body ; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle .,0
1683,The cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax .,1
1684,"The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day .",0
1685,"The electrical signals and mechanical actions , illustrated in [ link ] , are intimately intertwined .",0
1686,"The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial ( SA ) node , which is located near the wall of the right atrium .",0
1687,Electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison .,0
1688,The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs .,1
1689,"The major arteries diverge into minor arteries , and then smaller vessels called arterioles , to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body .",0
1690,The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart .,0
1691,Veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart .,1
1692,The major veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply .,0
1693,The lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava .,0
1694,Lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells .,1
1695,"The white blood cells remove infectious agents , such as bacteria and viruses , to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream .",0
1696,Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane .,1
1697,"Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .",1
1698,An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .,1
1699,"A non - electrolyte , in contrast , does n’t dissociate into ions during water dissolution .",0
1700,Both electrolytes and non - electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance .,0
1701,"Thus , one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams .",0
1702,The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution .,1
1703,The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent .,1
1704,"When they move to a hypertonic marine environment , these fish start drinking sea water ; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine , as illustrated in [ link]b .",0
1705,"Most marine invertebrates , on the other hand , may be isotonic with sea water ( osmoconformers ) .",0
1706,Their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration .,0
1707,"Externally , the kidneys are surrounded by three layers , illustrated in [ link ] .",0
1708,The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia .,1
1709,"The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .",1
1710,The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .,0
1711,"Internally , the kidney has three regions — an outer cortex , a medulla in the middle , and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney .",0
1712,The hilum is the concave part of the bean - shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney ; it is also the point of exit for the ureters .,1
1713,"The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .",0
1714,In between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass .,0
1715,"The tips of the pyramids , called renal papillae , point toward the renal pelvis .",0
1716,The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .,0
1717,"On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .",0
1718,The ureters are urine - bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder .,1
1719,Renal blood supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries ( which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through ) and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava .,0
1720,The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .,0
1721,"Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .",0
1722,The arcuate “ bow shaped ” arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids .,0
1723,"Cortical radiate arteries , as the name suggests , radiate out from the arcuate arteries .",0
1724,"The cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous afferent arterioles , and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons .",1
1725,"The renal corpuscle , located in the renal cortex , is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus and the capsule , a cup - shaped chamber that surrounds it , called the glomerular or Bowman 's capsule .",1
1726,"The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla .",1
1727,The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT ) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex .,0
1728,"The DCT , which is the last part of the nephron , connects and empties its contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids .",1
1729,"Within the glomerulus , the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed .",1
1730,"Once the efferent arteriole exits the glomerulus , it forms the peritubular capillary network , which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule .",0
1731,"In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT .",0
1732,"Second , the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules .",0
1733,Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption .,1
1734,"In the loop of Henle , the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network .",0
1735,This occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries .,0
1736,"However , every solute has a transport maximum and the excess is not reabsorbed . In the loop of Henle , the permeability of the membrane changes .",0
1737,"With the advent of video technology and cable television , the power of the president to reach huge audiences increased exponentially .",0
1738,"President Ronald Reagan , shown here giving one of his most famous speeches in Berlin , was an expert at using technology to help mold and project his presidential image to the public .",0

1740,"Eleanor Roosevelt took an active role in championing civil rights , becoming in some ways a bridge between her husband and the civil rights movement .",0
1741,"She coordinated meetings between FDR and members of the NAACP , championed antilynching legislation , openly defied segregation laws , and pushed the Army Nurse Corps to allow black women in its ranks .",0
1742,"Betty Ford took over as first lady in 1974 and became an avid advocate of women ’s rights , proclaiming that she was pro - choice when it came to abortion and lobbying for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) .",0

1746,"Her successors , Laura Bush in the first decade of the twenty - first century and Michelle Obama in the second , returned to the roles played by predecessors in advocating less controversial policies : Laura Bush advocated literacy and education , while Michelle Obama has emphasized physical fitness and healthy diet and exercise .",0

1754,Presidents also issue executive agreements with foreign powers .,0
1755,Executive agreements are formal agreements negotiated between two countries but not ratified by a legislature as a treaty must be .,0
1756,"Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt offered models of vigorous executive leadership , while the image and style of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan influenced and at times haunted or frustrated successors .",0
1757,"Nor is this impact limited to chief executives deemed successful : Lyndon Johnson ’s Vietnam and Richard Nixon ’s Watergate offered cautionary tales of presidential power gone wrong , leaving behind legacies that include terms like Vietnam syndrome and the tendency to add the suffix “ -gate ” to scandals and controversies . The youth and glamour that John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline brought to the White House in the early 1960s ( a ) helped give rise to the legend of “ one brief shining moment that was Camelot ” after Kennedy ’s presidency was cut short by his assassination on November 22 , 1963 .",0

1759,"Under the Articles of Confederation , there was no national judiciary .",0
1760,"The U.S. Constitution changed that , but its Article III , which addresses “ the judicial power of the United States , ” is the shortest and least detailed of the three articles that created the branches of government .",0
1761,"It calls for the creation of “ one supreme Court ” and establishes the Court ’s jurisdiction , or its authority to hear cases and make decisions about them , and the types of cases the Court may hear .",0
1762,"It was not until the Court ’s 146th year of operation that Congress , at the urging of Chief Justice — and former president — William Howard Taft , provided the designation and funding for the Supreme Court ’s own building , “ on a scale in keeping with the importance and dignity of the Court and the Judiciary as a coequal , independent branch of the federal government.”“Washington D.C.

1768,"Often credited with defining the modern court , clarifying its power , and strengthening its role , Marshall served in the chief ’s position for thirty - four years .",0
1769,The Supreme Court found itself in the middle of a dispute between the outgoing presidential administration of John Adams and that of incoming president ( and opposition party member ) Thomas Jefferson .,0
1770,"It was an interesting circumstance at the time , particularly because Jefferson and the man who would decide the case — John Marshall — were themselves political rivals .",0
1771,"Even with judicial review in place , the courts do not always stand ready just to throw out actions of the other branches of government .",0

Hobby Lobby that , for religious reasons , some for - profit corporations could be exempt from the requirement that employers provide insurance coverage of contraceptives for their female employees . Burwell v. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S. _ _ ( 2014 ) .",0

1781,"The judicial branch has often made decisions the other branches were either unwilling or unable to make , and Hamilton was right in Federalist No . 78 when he said that without the courts exercising their duty to defend the Constitution , “ all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing . ”",0
1782,"Each of the thirteen colonies had also had its own courts , based on the British common law model .",0
1783,"The judiciary today continues as a dual court system , with courts at both the national and state levels .",0
1784,"Both levels have three basic tiers consisting of trial courts , appellate courts , and finally courts of last resort , typically called supreme courts , at the top ( [ link ] ) .",0

1786,"When someone commits a criminal act , the government ( state or national , depending on which law has been broken ) charges that person with a crime , and the case brought to court contains the name of the charging government , as in Miranda v. Arizona discussed below . Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 ( 1966 ) .",0

1795,Each court is overseen by a rotating panel of three judges who do not hold trials but instead review the rulings of the trial ( district ) courts within their geographic circuit .,0

1828,"When oral arguments have been concluded , the justices have to decide the case , and they do so in conference , which is held in private twice a week when the Court is in session and once a week when it is not .",0
1829,"The conference is also a time to discuss petitions for certiorari , but for those cases already heard , each justice may state his or her views on the case , ask questions , or raise concerns .",0
1830,"Likewise , the most senior justice in the dissenting group can assign a member of that group to write the dissenting opinion ; however , any justice who disagrees with the majority may write a separate dissenting opinion .",0
1831,"If a justice agrees with the outcome of the case but not with the majority ’s reasoning in it , that justice may write a concurring opinion .",0
1832,"A judge or justice who views the role with an activist lens is more likely to use his or her judicial power to broaden personal liberty , justice , and equality .",0
1833,"Still others believe in judicial restraint , which leads them to defer decisions ( and thus policymaking ) to the elected branches of government and stay focused on a narrower interpretation of the Bill of Rights .",0

1842,"Thus , court rulings matter only to the extent they are heeded and followed .",0
1843,"Before the ratification of the Constitution , the state governments’ power far exceeded that held by the national government .",0
1844,This distribution of authority was the result of a conscious decision and was reflected in the structure and framework of the Articles of Confederation .,0
1845,"The national government was limited , lacking both a president to oversee domestic and foreign policy and a system of federal courts to settle disputes between the states .",0
1846,The Constitution allocated more power to the federal government by effectively adding two new branches : a president to head the executive branch and the Supreme Court to head the judicial branch .,0
1847,"The specific delegated or expressed powers granted to Congress and to the president were clearly spelled out in the body of the Constitution under Article I , Section 8 , and Article II , Sections 2 and 3 .",0
1848,"However , this result was not without its critics .",0
1849,"Initially , the Supreme Court overturned several key legislative proposals passed under Roosevelt , reasoning that they represented an overreach of presidential authority and were unconstitutional , such as Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States . A .",0

1852,These requests from the federal government are referred to as unfunded mandates and are a source of dissatisfaction to political actors at the state and local level .,0
1853,"To provide more transparency to state and local governments and reduce the federal government ’s use of mandates , the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act was passed in 1995 .",1

1858,Charters are similar to state constitutions : they provide a framework and a detailed accounting of local government responsibilities and areas of authority .,1
1859,States that align with Elazar ’s individualistic political culture see the government as a mechanism for addressing issues that matter to individual citizens and for pursuing individual goals .,0
1860,People in this culture interact with the government in the same manner they would interact with a marketplace .,0

1862,"Only elites belong in the political enterprise , and as a result , new public policies will be advanced only if they reinforce the beliefs and interests of those in power .",0
1863,Anyone elected to the office of governor assumes tremendous responsibility overnight .,0
1864,"He or she becomes the spokesperson for the entire state and their political party , accepts blame or praise for handling decision - making in times of crisis , oversees the implementation of public policy , and helps shepherd legislation through the lawmaking process .",0
1865,"Having introduced his or her priorities , the governor will work on the sidelines to steer favored bills through the legislative process .",0
1866,"This may entail holding meetings with committee chairs or other influential lawmakers concerning their legislative priorities , working with the media to try to get favorable coverage of legislative priorities , targeting advocacy organizations to maintain pressure on resistant lawmakers , or testifying in legislative hearings about the possible impacts of the legislation.“Governors’ Powers and Authority , ” http://www.nga.org/cms/home/management-resources/governors-powers-and-authority.html ( March 14 , 2016 ) .",0
1867,The line - item veto gives governors the ability to strike out a line or individual portions of a bill while letting the remainder pass into law .,0
1868,"In addition , approximately 30 percent of governors have the power of an amendatory veto , which allows them to send a bill back to the legislature and request a specific amendment to it .",0
1869,"Finally , a small number of governors , including the governor of Texas , also have the power of a reduction veto , which allows them to reduce the budget proposed in a piece of legislation . National Conference of State Legislatures .",0

1877,"Despite the tremendous formal powers that go with the job , being governor is still personally and professionally challenging .",0
1878,The demands of the job are likely to restrict time with family and require forgoing privacy .,0
1879,6901 .,0
1880,The most common form of county government is the commission system .,0
1881,"Under this structure , an elected commission , which generally consists of a small number of commissioners , serves as the governing body within the county , performing all legislative and executive functions .",0
1882,Municipal governments oversee the operation and functions of cities and towns .,0

Lavin , “ Census Bureau Reports There are 89,004 Local Governments in the United States ( CB12 - 161 ) . ” The vast majority of municipal governments operate on one of two governing models : a mayor - council system or a council - manager system .",0
1884,"Collectively , these essential workers are called the bureaucracy .",0
1885,A bureaucracy is an administrative group of nonelected officials charged with carrying out functions connected to a series of policies and programs .,1

1887,6916 .,0
1888,"Eventually , after President James Garfield had been assassinated by a disappointed office seeker ( [ link ] ) , Congress responded to cries for reform with the Pendleton Act , also called the Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 .",0
1889,"The act established the Civil Service Commission , a centralized agency charged with ensuring that the federal government ’s selection , retention , and promotion practices were based on open , competitive examinations in a merit system . For more on the Pendleton Act and its effects see Sean M. Theriault .",1

1891,"President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the U.S. Congress rapidly reorganized the government ’s problem - solving efforts into a series of programs designed to revive the economy , stimulate economic development , and generate employment opportunities .",0
1892,"In the 1930s , the federal bureaucracy grew with the addition of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to protect and regulate U.S. banking , the National Labor Relations Board to regulate the way companies could treat their workers , the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate the stock market , and the Civil Aeronautics Board to regulate air travel .",0
1893,"All of these new programs required bureaucrats to run them , and the national bureaucracy naturally ballooned .",0
1894,"Its size became a rallying cry for conservatives , who eventually elected Ronald Reagan president for the express purpose of reducing the bureaucracy .",0
1895,"While Reagan was able to work with Congress to reduce some aspects of the federal bureaucracy , he contributed to its expansion in other ways , particularly in his efforts to fight the Cold War . For more on LBJ and the Great Society see : John A. Andrew .",0
1896,"Second , the law raised the qualifications for employment in civil service positions by requiring applicants to pass exams designed to test their competence in a number of important skill and knowledge areas .",0

1899,"Congress and the president responded with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 , which abolished the Civil Service Commission .",0
1900,"In its place , the law created two new federal agencies : the Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) and the Merit Systems Protection Board ( MSPB ) .",0
1901,"The OPM has responsibility for recruiting , interviewing , and testing potential government employees in order to choose those who should be hired .",1
1902,"Later sociologists have not always looked so favorably upon bureaucracies , and they have developed alternate models to explain how and why bureaucracies function .",0
1903,One such model is called the acquisitive model of bureaucracy .,0
1904,The acquisitive model proposes that bureaucracies are naturally competitive and power - hungry .,1
1905,Agencies formed by the federal government to administer a quasi - business enterprise are called government corporations .,1
1906,"They exist because the services they provide are partly subject to market forces and tend to generate enough profit to be self - sustaining , but they also fulfill a vital service the government has an interest in maintaining .",0
1907,"Once the particulars of implementation have been spelled out in the legislation authorizing a new program , bureaucracies move to enact it .",0
1908,"When they encounter grey areas , many follow the federal negotiated rulemaking process to propose a solution , that is , detailing how particular new federal polices , regulations , and/or programs will be implemented in the agencies .",0
1909,"Congress can not possibly legislate on that level of detail , so the experts in the bureaucracy do so .",0
1910,"Perhaps Congress ’s most powerful oversight tool is the Government Accountability Office ( GAO).http://www.gao.gov/ ( May 1 , 2016 ) .",0
1911,"The GAO is an agency that provides Congress , its committees , and the heads of the executive agencies with auditing , evaluation , and investigative services .",1
1912,It is designed to operate in a fact - based and nonpartisan manner to deliver important oversight information where and when it is needed .,0
1913,"A more extreme , and in many instances , more controversial solution to the perceived and real inefficiencies in the bureaucracy is privatization .",0
1914,"In the United States , largely because it was born during the Enlightenment and has a long history of championing free - market principles , the urge to privatize government services has never been as strong as it is in many other countries .",0

1923,"Proponents of free - market economics believe that the market forces of supply and demand , working without any government involvement , are the most effective way for markets to operate .",0
1924,"One of the basic principles of free - market economics is that for just about any good that can be privatized , the most efficient means for exchange is the marketplace .",0
1925,"Economists consider goods like cable TV , cellphone service , and private schools to be toll goods .",0
1926,"Toll goods are similar to public goods in that they are open to all and theoretically infinite if maintained , but they are paid for or provided by some outside ( nongovernment ) entity .",1
1927,"In 1964 , Theodore Lowi argued that it was possible to categorize policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or diffused across the many .",0
1928,"One policy category , known as distributive policy , tends to collect payments or resources from many but concentrates direct benefits on relatively few .",1
1929,Highways are often developed through distributive policy .,0

1933,The U.S. government began developing a social welfare policy during the Great Depression of the 1930s .,0
1934,"By the 1960s , social welfare had become a major function of the federal government — one to which most public policy funds are devoted — and had developed to serve several overlapping functions .",0
1935,"One of the oldest and largest pieces of social welfare policy is Social Security , which cost the United States about $ 845 billion in 2014 alone.“An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook : 2014 to 2024 , ” 27 August 2014 . https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45653 ( March 1 , 2016 ) .",0

1937,Social Security was conceived as a solution to several problems inherent to the Industrial Era economy .,0
1938,"First , by the 1920s and 1930s , an increasing number of workers were earning their living through manual or day - wage labor that depended on their ability to engage in physical activity ( [ link ] ) .",0

1943,"Despite protesters’ resistance to government involvement in health care , there is no keeping government out of Medicare ; the government IS Medicare .",0
1944,A second approach to creating public policy is a bit more objective .,0
1945,"Rather than starting with what ought to happen and seeking ways to make it so , policy analysts try to identify all the possible choices available to a decision maker and then gauge their impacts if implemented .",0
1946,"The goal of the analyst is n’t really to encourage the implementation of any of the options ; rather , it is to make sure decision makers are fully informed about the implications of the decisions they do make .",0
1947,Acid rain provides another nice illustration of agenda setting and the problems and solutions subphases .,0
1948,"Acid rain is a widely recognized problem that did not make it on to the governmental policy agenda until Congress passed the Air Quality Act of 1967 , long after environmental groups started asking for laws to regulate pollution .",0
1949,"Until the 1930s , most policy advocates argued that the best way for the government to interact with the economy was through a hands - off approach formally known as laissez - faire economics .",0

1954,"Supply - siders have argued that increased regulation and higher taxes reduce the incentive to invest new money into the economy , to the point where little growth can occur .",0
1955,"In theory , the amount of revenue raised by the national government should be equal to these expenses , but with the exception of a brief period from 1998 to 2000 , that has not been the case .",0
1956,"The economic recovery from the 2007–2009 recession , and budget control efforts implemented since then , have managed to cut the annual deficit — the amount by which expenditures are greater than revenues — by more than half .",0
1957,"However , the amount of money the U.S. government needed to borrow to pay its bills in 2016 was still in excess of $ 400 billion“The Federal Budget in 2015 : An Infographic , ” 6 January 2016 . www.cbo.gov/publication/51110 ( March 1 , 2016 ) . .",0

1968,"A country is said to be engaging in protectionism when it does not permit other countries to sell goods and services within its borders , or when it charges them very high tariffs ( or import taxes ) to do so .",1
1969,"At the other end of the spectrum is a free trade approach , in which a country allows the unfettered flow of goods and services between itself and other countries .",1
1970,"At times the United States has been free trade – oriented , while at other times it has been protectionist .",0
1971,"For many , foreign policy is synonymous with diplomacy .",0
1972,"Diplomacy is the establishment and maintenance of a formal relationship between countries that governs their interactions on matters as diverse as tourism , the taxation of goods they trade , and the landing of planes on each other ’s runways .",1
1973,"While diplomatic relations are not always rosy , when they are operating it does suggest that things are going well between the countries .",0
1974,"Such war can be offensive , as were the Iraq War in 2003 and the 1989 removal of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega .",0

1996,"The sperm of modern gymnosperms lack flagella , but in cycads and the Gingko , the sperm still possess flagella that allow them to swim down the pollen tube to the female gamete ; however , they are enclosed in a pollen grain .",0
1997,"ost animals reproduce sexually , and the offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined and fixed body plan .",0
1998,"The body plan refers to the morphology of an animal , determined by developmental cues . All animals are heterotrophs that derive energy from food .",1
1999,"The ( a ) black bear is an omnivore , eating both plants and animals .",0
2000,"ext , the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation .",1
2001,"This leads to the formation of the next developmental stage , the gastrula , in which the future digestive cavity is formed .",1
2002,Different cell layers ( called germ layers ) are formed during gastrulation .,0
2003,"hese genes that determine animal structure are called “ homeotic genes , ” and they contain DNA sequences called homeoboxes .",1
2004,The animal genes containing homeobox sequences are specifically referred to as Hox genes .,1
2005,"This family of genes is responsible for determining the general body plan , such as the number of body segments of an animal , the number and placement of appendages , and animal head - tail directionality .",0
2006,"he animals that display radial symmetry develop two germ layers , an inner layer ( endoderm ) and an outer layer ( ectoderm ) .",1

2010,"Protostomes include arthropods , mollusks , and annelids .",0
2011,Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms .,0
2012,"ecent evidence has challenged this view of the development of the blastopore of protostomes , however , and the theory remains under debate . Another distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation , beginning from the gastrula stage .",0
2013,"The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely , meaning that during development , a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom .",1
2014,Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely .,0
2015,his is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage .,0
2016,"Deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage , where the cleavage axes are either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis , resulting in the alignment of the cells between the two poles .",0
2017,"he time before the Cambrian period is known as the Ediacaran period ( from about 635 million years ago to 543 million years ago ) , the final period of the late Proterozoic Neoproterozoic Era ( [ link ] ) .",1
2018,"It is believed that early animal life , termed Ediacaran biota , evolved from protists at this time .",1
2019,"n the other hand , cataclysmic events , such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life , can result in devastating losses of diversity .",0
2020,"Such periods of mass extinction ( [ link ] ) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life , erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind .",0
2021,"The end of the Permian period ( and the Paleozoic Era ) was marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth ’s history , a loss of roughly 95 percent of the extant species at that time .",0
2022,"orphology of SpongesThe morphology of the simplest sponges takes the shape of a cylinder with a large central cavity , the spongocoel , occupying the inside of the cylinder .",1
2023,Water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall .,0
2024,"he second crucial cells in sponges are called amoebocytes ( or archaeocytes ) , named for the fact that they move throughout the mesohyl in an amoeba - like fashion .",1
2025,"Amoebocytes have a variety of functions : delivering nutrients from choanocytes to other cells within the sponge , giving rise to eggs for sexual reproduction ( which remain in the mesohyl ) , delivering phagocytized sperm from choanocytes to eggs , and differentiating into more - specific cell types .",0
2026,"hylum Cnidaria includes animals that show radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic , that is , they develop from two embryonic layers . Nearly all ( about 99 percent ) cnidarians are marine species .",1
2027,lick here to follow the life cycle of the Obelia . All cnidarians show the presence of two membrane layers in the body that are derived from the endoderm and ectoderm of the embryo .,1
2028,"The outer layer ( from ectoderm ) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal , whereas the inner layer ( from endoderm ) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity .",0
2029,"Between these two membrane layers is a non - living , jelly - like mesoglea connective layer .",0
2030,"he cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity , enzymes are secreted into the cavity , and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients .",0
2031,"The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus , which is termed an incomplete digestive system .",1
2032,"Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis with water in the environment , and between cells in the gastrodermis with water in the gastrovascular cavity .",0
2033,"his is called protostomy or “ first mouth . ” In protostomy , solid groups of cells split from the endoderm or inner germ layer to form a central mesodermal layer of cells .",1
2034,This layer multiplies into a band and then splits internally to form the coelom ; this protostomic coelom is hence termed schizocoelom .,1
2035,he Nemertea are colloquially known as ribbon worms .,1
2036,"Most species of phylum Nemertea are marine , predominantly benthic or bottom dwellers , with an estimated 900 species known .",0
2037,"However , nemertini have been recorded in freshwater and terrestrial habitats as well .",0
2038,he zygote then develops into a planuliform larva .,0
2039,"In some nemertine species , a pilidium larva may develop inside the young worm , from a series of imaginal discs .",0
2040,"This larval form , characteristically shaped like a deerstalker cap , devours tissues from the young worm for survival before metamorphosing into the adult - like morphology .",1
2041,"dditionally , a tongue - like organ called a radula , which bears chitinous tooth - like ornamentation , is present in many species , and serves to shred or scrape food .",1
2042,The mantle ( also known as the pallium ) is the dorsal epidermis in mollusks ; shelled mollusks are specialized to secrete a chitinous and hard calcareous shell .,1
2043,Phylum Annelida includes segmented worms .,0
2044,"These animals are found in marine , terrestrial , and freshwater habitats , but a presence of water or humidity is a critical factor for their survival , especially in terrestrial habitats .",0
2045,Circular as well as longitudinal muscles are located interior to the epidermis .,0
2046,"Chitinous hairlike extensions , anchored in the epidermis and projecting from the cuticle , called setae / chaetae are present in every segment .",1
2047,"Annelids show the presence of a true coelom , derived from embryonic mesoderm and protostomy .",0
2048,"The name “ arthropoda ” means “ jointed legs ” ( in the Greek , “ arthros ” means “ joint ” and “ podos ” means “ leg ” ) ; it aptly describes the enormous number of invertebrates included in this phylum .",1
2049,Arthropoda dominate the animal kingdom with an estimated 85 percent of known species included in this phylum and many arthropods yet undocumented .,0
2050,The principal characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are functional segmentation of the body and presence of jointed appendages .,0
2051,"Unlike that of the Hexapoda , the head and thorax of most crustaceans is fused to form a cephalothorax ( [ link ] ) , which is covered by a plate called the carapace , thus producing a body structure of two tagma .",0
2052,Crustaceans have a chitinous exoskeleton that is shed by molting whenever the animal increases in size .,0
2053,Larval stages — nauplius and zoea — are seen in the early development of crustaceans .,0
2054,A cypris larva is also seen in the early development of barnacles ( [ link ] ) .,0

2060,"Phylum ChordataAnimals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage of their development : a notochord , a dorsal hollow nerve cord , pharyngeal slits , and a post - anal tail .",0
2061,"In some groups , some of these traits are present only during embryonic development .",0
2062,The dorsal hollow nerve cord derives from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development .,0
2063,"In chordates , it is located dorsal to the notochord .",0
2064,"The post - anal tail is a posterior elongation of the body , extending beyond the anus .",1
2065,"The tail contains skeletal elements and muscles , which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species , such as fishes .",0

2076,"Organs called ampullae of Lorenzini allow sharks to detect the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things , including their prey .",1
2077,Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals .,0
2078,"Water is drawn over gills that are located in chambers covered and ventilated by a protective , muscular flap called the operculum .",0
2079,"Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder , a gas - filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish .",1
2080,Bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades : Actinopterygii ( ray - finned fishes ) and Sarcopterygii ( lobe - finned fishes ) .,1
2081,"An estimated 185 species comprise caecilians , a group of amphibians that belong to the order Apoda .",1
2082,"Although they are vertebrates , a complete lack of limbs leads to their resemblance to earthworms in appearance .",0
2083,The amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration .,0

2091,Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body .,0
2092,"Apocrine glands , or scent glands , secrete substances that are used for chemical communication , such as in skunks .",1
2093,Mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns .,0
2094,"While male monotremes and eutherians possess mammary glands , male marsupials do not .",0
2095,"Most mammals have heterodont teeth , meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth .",1
2096,"Most mammals are diphyodonts , meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime : deciduous or “ baby ” teeth , and permanent teeth .",1
2097,"Other vertebrates are polyphyodonts , that is , their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life .",1
2098,"Marsupials are found primarily in Australia , though the opossum is found in North America .",0
2099,"Australian marsupials include the kangaroo , koala , bandicoot , Tasmanian devil ( [ link ] ) , and several other species .",0
2100,"The feathers on a wing are flexible , so the collective feathers move and separate as air moves through them , reducing the drag on the wing .",1
2101,"Flight feathers are asymmetrical , which affects airflow over them and provides some of the lifting and thrusting force required for flight ( [ link ] ) .",1
2102,"Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings , primary feathers and secondary feathers .",0
2103,"Secondary feathers are located closer to the body , attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift .",1
2104,"Contour feathers are the feathers found on the body , and they help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight .",1
2105,"They create a smooth , aerodynamic surface so that air moves smoothly over the bird ’s body , allowing for efficient flight .",0
2106,"Rather , Saurischia diverged into two groups : One included the long - necked herbivorous dinosaurs , such as Apatosaurus .",0
2107,"The second group , bipedal predators called theropods , includes birds .",1
2108,"This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds , specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones , as well as the presence of the wishbone , formed by the fusing of the clavicles . One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx , which is from the Jurassic period ( [ link ] ) .",0
2109,"After the extinction of Enantiornithes , modern birds became the dominant bird , with a large radiation occurring during the Cenozoic Era .",0
2110,"Referred to as Neornithes ( “ new birds ” ) , modern birds are now classified into two groups , the Paleognathae ( “ old jaw ” ) or ratites , a group of flightless birds including ostriches , emus , rheas , and kiwis , and the Neognathae ( “ new jaw ” ) , which includes all other birds .",1
2111,These proto - primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available .,0
2112,The oldest known primate - like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record is Plesiadapis ( although some researchers do not agree that Plesiadapis was a proto - primate ) .,1
2113,Fossils of this primate have been dated to approximately 55 million years ago .,0
2114,"Plant tissue systems fall into one of two general types : meristematic tissue , and permanent ( or non - meristematic ) tissue .",0
2115,"Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems , which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth .",1
2116,"Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant .",0
2117,"Meristematic tissues consist of three types , based on their location in the plant .",0
2118,"Apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots , which enable a plant to extend in length .",1
2119,Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .,1
2120,"They differentiate into three main types : dermal , vascular , and ground tissue .",0
2121,"Dermal tissue covers and protects the plant , and vascular tissue transports water , minerals , and sugars to different parts of the plant .",1
2122,"Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis , provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue , and helps to store water and sugars .",1
2123,"Plant stems , whether above or below ground , are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes ( [ link ] ) .",0
2124,"Nodes are points of attachment for leaves , aerial roots , and flowers .",1
2125,The stem region between two nodes is called an internode .,1
2126,An axillary bud is usually found in the axil — the area between the base of a leaf and the stem — where it can give rise to a branch or a flower .,1
2127,The apex ( tip ) of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud .,0
2128,"Sclerenchyma cells also provide support to the plant , but unlike collenchyma cells , many of them are dead at maturity .",1
2129,There are two types of sclerenchyma cells : fibers and sclereids .,0
2130,The latter two types conduct water and are dead at maturity .,0
2131,Tracheids are xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified .,1
2132,"Water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits , where secondary walls are absent .",0
2133,"Although still alive at maturity , the nucleus and other cell components of the sieve - tube cells have disintegrated .",0
2134,"Companion cells are found alongside the sieve - tube cells , providing them with metabolic support .",1
2135,"The companion cells contain more ribosomes and mitochondria than the sieve - tube cells , which lack some cellular organelles .",0
2136,Some plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment ( [ link ] ) .,0
2137,A rhizome is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and internodes .,1
2138,"Vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants , such as ginger and ferns .",0
2139,"Stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground , or just below the surface , and can give rise to new plants at the nodes .",1
2140,Runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals : strawberries are an example .,1
2141,"Tubers are modified stems that may store starch , as seen in the potato ( Solanum sp .",1
2142,) .,0
2143,Some aerial modifications of stems are tendrils and thorns ( [ link ] ) .,0
2144,"Tendrils are slender , twining strands that enable a plant ( like a vine or pumpkin ) to seek support by climbing on other surfaces .",1
2145,"Thorns are modified branches appearing as sharp outgrowths that protect the plant ; common examples include roses , Osage orange and devil ’s walking stick .",1
2146,"Dicots have a tap root system , while monocots have a fibrous root system .",0
2147,"A tap root system has a main root that grows down vertically , and from which many smaller lateral roots arise .",1
2148,"Dandelions are a good example ; their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds , and they can regrow another shoot from the remaining root ) .",0
2149,The epidermis provides protection and helps in absorption .,0
2150,"Root hairs , which are extensions of root epidermal cells , increase the surface area of the root , greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals .",1
2151,A waxy substance called suberin is present on the walls of the endodermal cells .,0
2152,"This waxy region , known as the Casparian strip , forces water and solutes to cross the plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells .",1
2153,"This ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis , while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded .",0
2154,"Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina , which is also the widest part of the leaf .",1
2155,Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole .,0
2156,Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves .,1
2157,"Within each leaf , the vascular tissue forms veins .",0
2158,The arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the venation pattern .,1
2159,Monocots and dicots differ in their patterns of venation ( [ link ] ) .,0
2160,Leaves may be simple or compound ( [ link ] ) .,0
2161,"In a simple leaf , the blade is either completely undivided — as in the banana leaf — or it has lobes , but the separation does not reach the midrib , as in the maple leaf .",1
2162,"In a compound leaf , the leaf blade is completely divided , forming leaflets , as in the locust tree .",1
2163,( common name “ umbrella plant ” ) .,0
2164,"Pinnately compound leaves take their name from their feather - like appearance ; the leaflets are arranged along the midrib , as in rose leaves ( Rosa sp .",0

2166,"In practical terms , therefore , water potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and pure water ( at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature ) .",1
2167,Water potential is denoted by the Greek letter ψ ( psi ) and is expressed in units of pressure ( pressure is a form of energy ) called megapascals ( MPa ) .,0
2168,"The potential of pure water ( Ψwpure H2O ) is , by convenience of definition , designated a value of zero ( even though pure water contains plenty of potential energy , that energy is ignored ) .",0
2169,Leaves are covered by a waxy cuticle on the outer surface that prevents the loss of water .,0
2170,"Regulation of transpiration , therefore , is achieved primarily through the opening and closing of stomata on the leaf surface .",0
2171,The aptly - named phototropins are protein - based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response .,1
2172,"Like all plant photoreceptors , phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light - absorbing portion , called the chromophore .",0
2173,Amyloplasts ( also known as statoliths ) are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle downward in response to gravity .,1
2174,Amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap .,0
2175,The effect of cytokinins was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid endosperm of coconuts to developing plant embryos in culture stimulated their growth .,0
2176,"The stimulating growth factor was found to be cytokinin , a hormone that promotes cytokinesis ( cell division ) .",1
2177,Almost 200 naturally occurring or synthetic cytokinins are known to date .,0
2178,"Ethylene is associated with fruit ripening , flower wilting , and leaf fall .",0
2179,Ethylene is unusual because it is a volatile gas ( C2H4 ) .,0
2180,"They act locally at the site of injury , and can also be transported to other tissues .",0
2181,Strigolactones promote seed germination in some species and inhibit lateral apical development in the absence of auxins .,1
2182,"Strigolactones also play a role in the establishment of mycorrhizae , a mutualistic association of plant roots and fungi .",1
2183,Glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes that slowly digest the insect .,0
2184,"The released nutrients are absorbed by the leaves , which reopen for the next meal . Thigmomorphogenesis is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant subjected to continuous mechanical stress .",1
2185,"When trees bend in the wind , for example , growth is usually stunted and the trunk thickens .",0
2186,"Plants require only light , water and about 20 elements to support all their biochemical needs : these 20 elements are called essential nutrients ( [ link ] ) .",0
2187,"For an element to be regarded as essential , three criteria are required : 1 ) a plant can not complete its life cycle without the element ; 2 ) no other element can perform the function of the element ; and 3 ) the element is directly involved in plant nutrition .",0
2188,"Plants obtain inorganic elements from the soil , which serves as a natural medium for land plants .",0

2192,Yet it was Franklin D. Roosevelt who became famous for harnessing the political power of radio .,0
2193,"On entering office in March 1933 , President Roosevelt needed to quiet public fears about the economy and prevent people from removing their money from the banks .",0
2194,"Stations chose their own broadcasting locations , signal strengths , and frequencies , which sometimes overlapped with one another or with the military , leading to tuning problems for listeners .",0
2195,"The Radio Act ( 1927 ) created the Federal Radio Commission ( FRC ) , which made the first effort to set standards , frequencies , and license stations .",1

2232,"Winner - take - all systems of electing candidates to office , which exist in several countries other than the United States , require that the winner receive either the majority of votes or a plurality of the votes .",0
2233,U.S. elections are based on plurality voting .,0
2234,"Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .",1
2235,The argument for this method is that it is ultimately the party and not the individual who will influence policy .,0
2236,"Under this model of proportional representation , legislative seats are allocated to competing parties based on the total share of votes they receive in the election .",1

2244,"While the lowest level of party organization is technically the precinct , many of the operational responsibilities for local elections fall upon the county - level organization .",0
2245,"The county - level organization is in many ways the workhorse of the party system , especially around election time .",0
2246,"In 2012 , for example , only one - third of the eligible voters in New Hampshire voted in the state ’s primary , one of the earliest and thus most important in the nation ; however , 70 percent of eligible voters in the state voted in the general election in November 2012.“Voter Turnout , ” http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data ( March 14 , 2016 ) .",0

2256,"This is especially the case in the Senate , which is a super - majority institution .",0
2257,The past thirty years have brought a dramatic change in the relationship between the two parties as fewer conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans have been elected to office .,0
2258,"As political moderates , or individuals with ideologies in the middle of the ideological spectrum , leave the political parties at all levels , the parties have grown farther apart ideologically , a result called party polarization .",1
2259,"In other words , at least organizationally and in government , Republicans and Democrats have become increasingly dissimilar from one another ( [ link ] ) .",0
2260,Perhaps the clearest sign of Congress’ ineffectiveness is that the threat of government shutdown has become a constant .,0
2261,Shutdowns occur when Congress and the president are unable to authorize and appropriate funds before the current budget runs out .,0
2262,"A final possible cause for polarization is the increasing sophistication of gerrymandering , or the manipulation of legislative districts in an attempt to favor a particular candidate ( [ link ] ) .",1

2266,"But whereas interest groups often work indirectly to influence our leaders , political parties are organizations that try to directly influence public policy through its members who seek to win and hold public office .",1
2267,"Parties accomplish this by identifying and aligning sets of issues that are important to voters in the hopes of gaining support during elections ; their positions on these critical issues are often presented in documents known as a party platform ( [ link ] ) , which is adopted at each party ’s presidential nominating convention every four years .",0

2353,"This exception is encoded within the Constitution in Article I , Section 7 , which states , “ All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills . ” Yet , despite the seemingly clear language of the Constitution , Congress has found ways to get around this rule .",0
2354,"This flexibility about speaking in the Senate gave rise to a unique tactic , the filibuster .",0
2355,"The word “ filibuster ” comes from the Dutch word vrijbuiter , which means pirate .",0
2356,"This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’s record twenty - four - hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty - five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .",0
2357,"Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) .",0

2408,"However , President Woodrow Wilson , owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments , vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way .",0
2409,"His successor , Warren Harding , felt differently and signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 .",0

2500,"Even when there are other options on the ballot , most voters understand that minor parties have no real chance of winning even a single office .",0
2501,"Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .",1

Bliss Institute of Applied Politics , “ Local elections tend to be about things like sewers , and roads and police protection — which are not as dramatic an issue as same - sex marriage or global warming or international affairs.”Elizabeth Lehman , “ Trend Shows Generation Focuses Mostly on Social , National Issues , ” http://www.thenewsoutlet.org/survey-local-millennials-more-interested-in-big-issues/ ( March 15 , 2016 ) .",0
2519,"Presidential elections and the behavior of the U.S. Congress are also far more likely to make the news broadcasts than the activities of county commissioners , and the national - level party organization is mostly responsible for coordinating the activities of participants at this level .",0
2520,The national party is a fundraising army for presidential candidates and also serves a key role in trying to coordinate and direct the efforts of the House and Senate .,0
2521,"One of the first challenges facing the party - in - government , or the party identifiers who have been elected or appointed to hold public office , is to achieve their policy goals .",1
2522,The means to do this is chosen in meetings of the two major parties ; Republican meetings are called party conferences and Democrat meetings are called party caucuses .,1
2523,"Key benefits like committee appointments , leadership positions , and money for important projects in their home district may hinge on legislators following the lead of the party .",0
2524,"These pressures are particularly acute for the majority party , so named because it controls more than half the seats in one of the two chambers .",1
2525,"The Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader , the majority party ’s congressional leaders , have significant tools at their disposal to punish party members who defect on a particular vote .",0
2526,"For the first few decades of the current pattern of divided government , the threat it posed to the government appears to have been muted by a high degree of bipartisanship , or cooperation through compromise .",1
2527,Many pieces of legislation were passed in the 1960s and 1970s with reasonably high levels of support from both parties .,0
2528,Movements on the left have also arisen .,0
2529,"The Occupy Wall Street movement was born of the government ’s response to the Great Recession of 2008 and its assistance to endangered financial institutions , provided through the Troubled Asset Relief Program , TARP ( [ link ] ) .",0
2530,The Occupy Movement believed the recession was caused by a failure of the government to properly regulate the banking industry .,0
2531,Several conflicting theories have been offered .,0
2532,"The first and perhaps best argument is that polarization is a party - in - government phenomenon driven by a decades - long sorting of the voting public , or a change in party allegiance in response to shifts in party position . Morris Fiorina , “ Americans Have Not Become More Politically Polarized , ” The Washington Post , 23 June 2014 .",0
2533,"According to the sorting thesis , before the 1950s , voters were mostly concerned with state - level party positions rather than national party concerns .",0
2534,"Since parties are bottom - up institutions , this meant local issues dominated elections ; it also meant national - level politicians typically paid more attention to local problems than to national party politics .",0
2535,"Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives .",1
2536,"This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes .",0
2537,"According to political scientist Nolan McCarty , there is little evidence to support the redistricting hypothesis alone .",0
2538,"First , he argues , the Senate has become polarized just as the House of Representatives has , but people vote for Senators on a statewide basis .",0
2539,In Federalist No .,0
2540,"itten in the late eighteenth century , James Madison noted that the formation of self - interested groups , which he called factions , was inevitable in any society , as individuals started to work together to protect themselves from the government .",1
2541,Interest groups and political parties are two of the most easily identified forms of factions in the United States .,0
2542,Encyclopedia of American Political Parties and Elections .,0
2543,"New York : Checkmark Books , 151 .",0
2544,Anti - Federalists preferred a more confederate system built on state equality and autonomy . Saul Cornell .,0
2545,6518 .,0
2546,"However , members of each faction quickly realized that they had a vested interest not only in nominating and electing a president who shared their views , but also in winning other elections .",0
2547,"Two loosely affiliated party coalitions , known as the Federalists and the Democratic - Republicans , soon emerged .",0
2548,"The Federalists succeeded in electing their first leader , John Adams , to the presidency in 1796 , only to see the Democratic - Republicans gain victory under Thomas Jefferson four years later in 1800 .",0
2549,Andrew Jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the Electoral College than any other candidate .,0
2550,"However , because he did not win the majority ( more than half ) of the available electoral votes , the election was decided by the House of Representatives , as required by the Twelfth Amendment .",0
2551,The Twelfth Amendment limited the House ’s choice to the three candidates with the greatest number of electoral votes .,0
2552,"New York : Oxford University Press , 330 - 34 .",0
2553,Many of these positions were given to party bosses and their friends .,0
2554,"These men were the leaders of political machines , organizations that secured votes for the party ’s candidates or supported the party in other ways .",1
2555,"Perhaps more importantly , this election - focused organization also sought to maintain power by creating a broader coalition and thereby expanding the range of issues upon which the party was constructed . Sean Wilentz .",0
2556,"Roosevelt attempted to form a third party , known as the Progressive Party , as an alternative to the more business - minded Republicans .",0
2557,"The Progressives sought to correct the many problems that had arisen as the United States transformed itself from a rural , agricultural nation into an increasingly urbanized , industrialized country dominated by big business interests .",1
2558,"On April 15 ( or “ tax day ” ) , 2010 , members of the Tea Party movement rallied at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul in favor of smaller government and against the Affordable Care Act ( left ) .",0
2559,"Two years later , supporters of the law ( right ) demonstrated in front of the U.S. Supreme Court during oral arguments in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , in which the Court eventually upheld most provisions of the law .",0

2561,"Formally , a lobbyist is someone who represents the interest organization before government , is usually compensated for doing so , and is required to register with the government in which he or she lobbies , whether state or federal .",1
2562,The lobbyist ’s primary goal is usually to influence policy .,0
2563,“ Interest Groups in the States . ” In Politics in the American States .,0
2564,"Washington , DC : CQ Press , 105–131 .",0
2565,"First , interest groups may take the form of membership organizations , which individuals join voluntarily and to which they usually pay dues .",1
2566,"Membership groups often consist of people who have common issues or concerns , or who want to be with others who share their views .",0
2567,"Interest groups also include associations , which are typically groups of institutions that join with others , often within the same trade or industry ( trade associations ) , and have similar concerns .",0
2568,"The American Beverage Associationhttp://www.ameribev.org/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .",0
2569,"includes Coca - Cola , Red Bull North America , ROCKSTAR , and Kraft Foods .",0
2570,"While influencing policy is the primary goal , interest groups also monitor government activity , serve as a means of political participation for members , and provide information to the public and to lawmakers .",0
2571,"According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , by November 2015 , thirty - six states had laws requiring that voters provide identification at the polls.http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx ( November 78 , 2015 ) .",0
2572,A civil rights group like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) will keep track of proposed voter - identification bills in state legislatures that might have an effect on voting rights .,0
2573,This organization will contact lawmakers to voice approval or disapproval of proposed legislation ( inside lobbying ) and encourage group members to take action by either donating money to it or contacting lawmakers about the proposed bill ( outside lobbying ) .,0
2574,"On the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods .",0
2575,Such collective goods are benefits — tangible or intangible — that help most or all citizens .,1
2576,"These goods are often produced collectively , and because they may not be profitable and everyone may not agree on what public goods are best for society , they are often underfunded and thus will be underproduced unless there is government involvement .",0
2577,Group leaders also play an important role in overcoming collective action problems .,0
2578,"For instance , political scientist Robert Salisbury suggests that group leaders will offer incentives to induce activity among individuals . Robert Salisbury , “ An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups , ” Midwest Journal of Political Science 13 ( 1969 ) : 1–32 ; Peter B. Clark and James Q. Wilson , “ Incentive Systems : A Theory of Organizations , ” Administration Science Quarterly 6 ( 1961 ) : 129–166 .",0
2579,"Some offer material incentives , which are tangible benefits of joining a group .",1
2580,"AARP , for example , offers discounts on hotel accommodations and insurance rates for its members , while dues are very low , so they can actually save money by joining .",0
2581,"Rather than being a single disturbance , debate about immigration policy has ebbed and flowed in recent years , creating what might best be described as a series of minor disturbances .",0
2582,"When , during his presidential candidacy , Donald Trump made controversial statements about immigrants , many rallied both for and against him . Jenna Johnson , “ Immigration continues to be Donald Trump ’s rallying issue , ” Washington Post , 22 October 2015 , https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/22/immigration-continues-to-be-donald-trumps-rallying-issue/.Protestors take to the streets on different sides of the immigration issue .",0
2583,"Some argue that the United States is a nation of immigrants , whereas others demonstrate in support of greater restrictions on immigration .",0
2584,"Joining interest groups can help facilitate civic engagement , which allows people to feel more connected to the political and social community .",0
2585,"Some interest groups develop as grassroots movements , which often begin from the bottom up among a small number of people at the local level .",1
2586,Interest groups can amplify the voices of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers .,0
2587,"On the other hand , stem cell research is highly salient to members of the American Neurological Association , an interest organization that represents academic neurologists and neuroscientists .",0
2588,"Accordingly , different interests represent the more specialized needs of different specialties within the medical community , but fragmentation can occur when a large interest like this has diverging needs .",0
2589,"Such was also the case when several unions split from the AFL - CIO ( American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations ) , the nation ’s largest federation of unions , in 2005.Thomas and Hrebenar , “ Interest Groups in the States , ” 1991 , 1996 , 1999 , 2004 ; Thomas and Hrebenar , “ Nationalization of Interest Groups and Lobbying in the States . ” Improved technology and the development of social media have made it easier for smaller groups to form and to attract and communicate with members .",0
2590,"However , not all scholars accept the premise that mobilization is natural and that all groups have the potential for access to decision - makers .",0
2591,"The elite critique suggests that certain interests , typically businesses and the wealthy , are advantaged and that policies more often reflect their wishes than anyone else ’s .",1
2592,Political scientist E. E. Schattschneider noted that “ the flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upperclass accent.”E .,0
2593,E. Schattschneider .,0
2594,"While most scholars agree that some interests do have advantages , others have questioned the overwhelming dominance of certain interests .",0
2595,"Additionally , neopluralist scholars argue that certainly some interests are in a privileged position , but these interests do not always get what they want . Virginia Gray and David Lowery .",0
2596,6569 .,0
2597,"In Buckley v. Valeo ( 1976 ) , the Supreme Court upheld Congress ’s right to regulate elections by restricting contributions to campaigns and candidates .",1
2598,"However , at the same time , it overturned restrictions on expenditures by candidates and their families , as well as total expenditures by campaigns . Buckley v. Valeo , 75 - 436 , 424 U.S. 1 ( 1976 ) .",0
2599,"In 1979 , an exemption was granted to get - out - the vote and grassroots voter registration drives , creating what has become known as the soft - money loophole ; soft money was a way in which interests could spend money on behalf of candidates without being restricted by federal law .",1
2600,"Some continued to argue that campaign expenditures are a form of speech , a position with which two recent Supreme Court decisions are consistent .",0
2601,"The Citizens United v. Federal Election CommissionCitizens United v. Federal Election Commission , 08 - 205 , 558 U.S. 310 ( 2010 ) .",0

2603,cases opened the door for a substantially greater flow of money into elections .,0
2604,Citizens United overturned the soft money ban of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections .,1
2605,"While the Supreme Court has paved the way for increased spending in politics , lobbying is still regulated in many ways . Adam J. Newmark , “ Measuring State Legislative Lobbying Regulation , 1990–2003 . ” State Politics and Policy Quarterly 5 ( 2005 ) : 182–191 ; Nownes and Newmark , “ Interest Groups in the States . ” The 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act defined who can and can not lobby , and requires lobbyists and interest groups to register with the federal government . Nownes , Interest Groups in American Politics .",0
2606,The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 further increased restrictions on lobbying .,0
2607,"For example , the act prohibited contact between members of Congress and lobbyists who were the spouses of other Congress members .",0
2608,"States deep in debt were printing increasingly worthless paper currency , many were mired in interstate trade battles with each other , and in western Massachusetts , a small group of Revolutionary War veterans angry over the prospect of losing their farms broke into armed open revolt against the state , in what came to be known as Shays’ Rebellion .",1
2609,The conclusion many reached was that the Articles of Confederation were simply not strong enough to keep the young republic together .,0
2610,"In the spring of 1787 , a convention was called , and delegates from all the states ( except Rhode Island , which boycotted the convention ) were sent to Philadelphia to hammer out a solution to this central problem .",0
2611,The storm of debate over how to allocate power between large and small states was eventually calmed by a third proposal .,0
2612,"The Connecticut Compromise , also called the Great Compromise , proposed a bicameral congress with members apportioned differently in each house .",1
2613,"The upper house , the Senate , was to have two members from each state .",0
2614,"Congressional apportionment today is achieved through the equal proportions method , which uses a mathematical formula to allocate seats based on U.S. Census Bureau population data , gathered every ten years as required by the Constitution .",1
2615,"At the close of the first U.S. Congress in 1791 , there were sixty - five representatives , each representing approximately thirty thousand citizens .",0
2616,"While the strangely drawn districts succeeded in their stated goals , nearly quintupling the number of African American representatives in Congress in just over two decades , they have frustrated others who claim they are merely a new form of an old practice , gerrymandering .",0
2617,Gerrymandering is the manipulation of legislative district boundaries as a way of favoring a particular candidate .,1
2618,An implied power is one not specifically detailed in the Constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government .,1
2619,"And an inherent power , while not enumerated or implied , must be assumed to exist as a direct result of the country ’s existence .",1
2620,"In this section , we will learn about each type of power and the foundations of legitimacy they claim .",0
2621,"But in United States v. Lopez , a decision issued in 1995 , the Court changed course again and , for the first time in half a century , struck down a law as an unconstitutional overstepping of the commerce clause . United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 ( 1995 ) .",0
2622,"Five years later , the Court did it again , convincing many that the country may be witnessing the beginning of a rollback in Congress ’s power to regulate in the states .",0
2623,"When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( also known as the ACA , or Obamacare ) came before the Supreme Court in 2012 , many believed the Court would strike it down .",0
2624,"But presidents have sought to increase their power almost from the beginning , typically at the expense of the Congress .",0
2625,"By the nature of the enumerated powers provided to the president , it is during wartime that the chief executive is most powerful and Congress least powerful .",0
2626,"For example , President Abraham Lincoln , who oversaw the prosecution of the Civil War , stretched the bounds of his legal authority in a number of ways , such as by issuing the Emancipation Proclamation that freed slaves in the confederate states.“Abraham Lincoln : Impact and Legacy , ” http://millercenter.org­/president/biography/lincoln-impact-and-legacy ( May 24 , 2016 ) .",0
2627,"Following the twin scandals of Vietnam and Watergate in the early 1970s , Congress attempted to assert itself as a coequal branch , even in creating foreign policy , but could not hold back the trend .",0
2628,The War Powers Resolution ( covered in the foreign policy chapter ) was intended to strengthen congressional war powers but ended up clarifying presidential authority in the first sixty days of a military conflict .,0
2629,The war on terrorism after 9/11 has also strengthened the president ’s hand .,0
2630,"Another important reform occurred in 2002 , when Senators John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Russell Feingold ( D - WI ) drafted , and Congress passed , the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( BCRA ) , also referred to as the McCain - Feingold Act .",0
2631,"The purpose of this law was to limit the use of “ soft money , ” which is raised for purposes like party - building efforts , get - out - the - vote efforts , and issue - advocacy ads .",1
2632,"In the wake of the Citizens United decision , a new type of advocacy group emerged , the super PAC .",0
2633,A traditional PAC is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or defeat candidates .,1
2634,"Such PACs tended to be run by businesses and other groups , like the Teamsters Union and the National Rifle Association , to support their special interests .",0
2635,"Despite the power of the conferences , however , the most important leadership position in the House is actually elected by the entire body of representatives .",0
2636,This position is called the Speaker of the House and is the only House officer mentioned in the Constitution .,0
2637,"The Constitution does not require the Speaker to be a member of the House , although to date , all fifty - four Speakers have been .",0
2638,"However , the majority rules the day in the House , like a cartel .",0
2639,"On the majority side , because it holds the speakership , the majority leader also has considerable power .",0
2640,"Historically , moreover , the majority leader tends to be in the best position to assume the speakership when the current Speaker steps down .",0
2641,"There are well over two hundred committees , subcommittees , select committees , and joint committees in the Congress .",0
2642,The core committees are called standing committees .,1
2643,There are twenty standing committees in the House and sixteen in the Senate ( [ link ] ) .,0
2644,"In 2016 , Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa ( a ) , the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , refused to hold hearings on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court , despite the urging of his committee colleagues .",0
2645,"In the meantime , Garland met with numerous senators , such as Republican Susan Collins of Maine ( b ) .",0
2646,"Once hearings have been completed , the bill enters the markup stage .",0
2647,This is essentially an amending and voting process .,1
2648,"To invoke cloture , the Senate had to get a two - thirds majority .",0
2649,"This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’s record twenty - four - hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two - thirds to three - fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty - five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .",0
2650,"Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) .",0
2651,"In a defining moment for the filibuster , Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina spoke for twenty - four hours and eighteen minutes against a weak civil rights bill in 1957 .",0
2652,"A vocal proponent of segregation and white supremacy , Thurmond had made no secret of his views and had earlier run for the presidency on a segregationist platform .",0
2653,"Some interests groups form political action committees ( PACs ) , groups that collect funds from donors and distribute them to candidates who support their issues .",1
2654,"As [ link ] makes apparent , many large corporations like Honeywell International , AT&T , and Lockheed Martin form PACs to distribute money to candidates.https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .",0
2655,Other PACs are either politically or ideologically oriented .,0
2656,"For example , a proposed tax increase may result in the formation or mobilization of anti - tax groups that will lobby the legislature and try to encourage the public to oppose the proposed legislation .",0
2657,"Prior to the election in 2012 , political activist Grover Norquist , the founder of Americans for Tax Reform ( ATR ) , asked all Republican members of Congress to sign a “ Taxpayer Protection Pledge ” that they would fight efforts to raise taxes or to eliminate any deductions that were not accompanied by tax cuts .",0
2658,"Ninety - five percent of the Republicans in Congress signed the pledge .

2659,Some interests arise solely to defeat legislation and go dormant after they achieve their immediate objectives .,0
2660,They are not permitted the liberty of employing their own reason and judgment while acting as representatives in Congress .,0
2661,This is the delegate model of representation .,0
2662,"Instead , proper representation for some is rooted in the racial , ethnic , socioeconomic , gender , and sexual identity of the representatives themselves .",1
2663,This form of representation is called descriptive representation .,0
2664,"The NWPC was formed by Bella Abzug ( [ link ] ) , Gloria Steinem , Shirley Chisholm , and other leading feminists to encourage women ’s participation in political parties , elect women to office , and raise money for their campaigns .",1
2665,"For example , Patsy Mink ( D - HI ) ( [ link ] ) , the first Asian American woman elected to Congress , was the coauthor of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 , Title IX of which prohibits sex discrimination in education .",0
2666,"Mink had been interested in fighting discrimination in education since her youth , when she opposed racial segregation in campus housing while a student at the University of Nebraska .",0
2667,"And as representatives of their constituents , they are charged with addressing those constituents’ interests .",0
2668,"Historically , this job has included what some have affectionately called “ bringing home the bacon ” but what many ( usually those outside the district in question ) call pork - barrel politics .",0
2669,"As a term and a practice , pork - barrel politics — federal spending on projects designed to benefit a particular district or set of constituents — has been around since the nineteenth century , when barrels of salt pork were both a sign of wealth and a system of reward .",1
2670,"Indeed , when the ratings are graphed , the two noticeable peaks are at 57 percent in 1998 and 84 percent in 2001 ( [ link ] ) .",0
2671,"In 1998 , according to Gallup polling , the rise in approval accompanied a similar rise in other mood measures , including President Bill Clinton ’s approval ratings and general satisfaction with the state of the country and the economy .",0
2672,"In 2001 , approval spiked after the September 11 terrorist attacks and the Bush administration launched the """" War on Terror , """" sending troops first to Afghanistan and later to Iraq .",0
2673,"The Articles of Confederation made no provision for an executive branch , although they did use the term “ president ” to designate the presiding officer of the Confederation Congress , who also handled other administrative duties . Articles of Confederation , Article XI , 1781 .",0
2674,"The presidency was proposed early in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia by Virginia ’s Edmund Randolph , as part of James Madison ’s proposal for a federal government , which became known as the Virginia Plan .",0
2675,"Madison offered a rather sketchy outline of the executive branch , leaving open whether what he termed the “ national executive ” would be an individual or a set of people .",0
2676,"He proposed that Congress select the executive , whose powers and authority , and even length of term of service , were left largely undefined .",0
2677,"By early September , the Electoral College had emerged as the way to select a president for four years who was eligible for reelection .",0
2678,This process is discussed more fully in the chapter on elections .,0
2679,This should have meant that Texas ’s 32 electoral votes could have gone to only one or the other .,0
2680,"Cheney anticipated this problem and had earlier registered to vote in Wyoming , where he was originally from and where he had served as a representative years earlier . Alan Clendenning , “ Court : Cheney Is Wyoming Resident , ” ABC News , 7 December 2000 , http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122289&page=1 ( May 1 , 2016 ) .",0
2681,"It ’s hard to imagine that the 2000 presidential election could have been even more complicated than it was , but thanks to that seemingly innocuous rule in Article II of the Constitution , that was a real possibility .",0
2682,An important means of ensuring that no president could become tyrannical was to build into the Constitution a clear process for removing the chief executive — impeachment .,0
2683,Impeachment is the act of charging a government official with serious wrongdoing ; the Constitution calls this wrongdoing high crimes and misdemeanors .,1
2684,"The most recent impeachment was of President Bill Clinton , brought on by his lying about an extramarital affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky .",0
2685,House Republicans felt the affair and Clinton ’s initial public denial of it rose to a level of wrongdoing worthy of impeachment .,0
2686,Later presidents built on the foundation of these powers .,0
2687,"Some waged undeclared wars , as John Adams did against the French in the Quasi - War ( 1798–1800 ) .",0
2688,"Others agreed to negotiate for significant territorial gains , as Thomas Jefferson did when he oversaw the purchase of Louisiana from France .",0
2689,James Monroe used his annual message in 1823 to declare that the United States would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for European powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the Western Hemisphere .,1
2690,"Later dubbed the Monroe Doctrine , this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of American power in the twentieth century .",0
2691,Andrew Jackson employed the veto as a measure of policy to block legislative initiatives with which he did not agree and acted unilaterally when it came to depositing federal funds in several local banks around the country instead of in the Bank of the United States .,0
2692,"He then responded to the newly heightened state of affairs by sending U.S. troops to the Rio Grande , the border Texan expansionists claimed for Texas .",0
2693,"Mexico sent troops in response , and the Mexican - American War began soon afterward . Fred Greenstein .",0
2694,6674 .,0
2695,"In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , Lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty .",0
2696,"He also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the Emancipation Proclamation , which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of slaves in Confederate - controlled territory to be free .",0
2697,"His successor , Andrew Johnson , became so embroiled with Radical Republicans about ways to implement Reconstruction policies and programs after the Civil War that the House of Representatives impeached him , although the legislators in the Senate were unable to successfully remove him from office . Michael Les Benedict .",0
2698,"Constitution , Article II , Section 1 .",0
2699,"As the federal bureaucracy expanded , so too did the president ’s power to grow agencies like the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .",0
2700,"Presidents also further developed the concept of executive privilege , the right to withhold information from Congress , the judiciary , or the public .",1
2701,"This right , not enumerated in the Constitution , was first asserted by George Washington to curtail inquiry into the actions of the executive branch . Mark J. Rozel .",0
2702,"Reformers proposed the solution of putting the executive branch in charge of developing a budget that could be scrutinized , amended , and approved by Congress .",0
2703,"However , President Woodrow Wilson , owing to a provision tacked onto the bill regarding presidential appointments , vetoed the legislation that would have transformed the budgeting process in this way .",0
2704,"His successor , Warren Harding , felt differently and signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 .",0
2705,"Following the first election of Washington , the political party system gained steam and power in the electoral process , creating separate nomination and general election stages .",0
2706,"Early on , the power to nominate presidents for office bubbled up from the party operatives in the various state legislatures and toward what was known as the king caucus or congressional caucus .",0
2707,The caucus or large - scale gathering was made up of legislators in the Congress who met informally to decide on nominees from their respective parties .,1
2708,The rise of the primary system during the Progressive Era came at the cost of party regulars’ control of the process of candidate selection .,0
2709,Some party primaries even allow registered independents or members of the opposite party to vote .,0
2710,"When Washington declined to run again after two terms , matters worsened .",0
2711,"In 1796 , political rivals John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were elected president and vice president , respectively .",0
2712,"Yet the two men failed to work well together during Adams ’s administration , much of which Jefferson spent at his Virginia residence at Monticello .",0
2713,"Following the 2000 presidential election , when then - governor George W. Bush won by a single electoral vote and with over half a million fewer individual votes than his challenger , astonished voters called for Electoral College reform .",0
2714,"Years later , however , nothing of any significance had been done .",0
2715,6698 .,0
2716,The president hoped that by nominating a former senator from the opposition he could ensure the confirmation process would go smoothly .,0
2717,"Instead , however , Senator Ted Cruz used the confirmation hearing to question the Vietnam War hero ’s patriotism .",0
2718,Hagel was eventually confirmed by a 58–41 vote .,0
2719,"When Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in early 2016 , many in Washington braced for a political sandstorm of obstruction and accusations .",0
2720,"Such was the record of Supreme Court nominations during the Obama administration and , indeed , for the last few decades .",0
2721,But presidents have typically used this loophole to get around a Senate that ’s inclined to obstruct .,0
2722,"Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush made 139 and 171 recess appointments , respectively .",0
2723,"President Obama has made far fewer recess appointments ; as of May 1 , 2015 , he had made only thirty - two . Bruce Drake , “ Obama lags his predecessors in recess appointments , ” 13 January 2014 , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/13/obama-lags-his-predecessors-in-recess-appointments/ ( May 1 , 2016 ) .",0
2724,"One reason this number is so low is another loophole the Senate began using at the end of George W. Bush ’s presidency , the pro forma session .",0
2725,"Vice presidents were often sent on minor missions or used as mouthpieces for the administration , often with a sharp edge .",0
2726,Richard Nixon ’s vice president Spiro Agnew is an example .,0
2727,"But in the 1970s , starting with Jimmy Carter , presidents made a far more conscious effort to make their vice presidents part of the governing team , placing them in charge of increasingly important issues .",0
2728,"In the case of George W. Bush and his very experienced vice president Dick Cheney , observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence .",0
2729,"Barack Obama ’s choice for a running mate and subsequent two - term vice president , former Senator Joseph Biden , was picked for his experience , especially in foreign policy .",0
2730,President Obama relied on Vice President Biden for advice throughout his tenure .,0
2731,"With the popularization of radio in the early twentieth century , it became possible to broadcast the president ’s voice into many of the nation ’s homes .",0
2732,"Within the soil profile , soil scientists define zones called horizons .",0
2733,A horizon is a soil layer with distinct physical and chemical properties that differ from those of other layers .,1
2734,"Five factors account for soil formation : parent material , climate , topography , biological factors , and time . Parent Material",0
2735,"Animals and microorganisms can produce pores and crevices , and plant roots can penetrate into crevices to produce more fragmentation .",0
2736,"Plant secretions promote the development of microorganisms around the root , in an area known as the rhizosphere .",1
2737,"Additionally , leaves and other material that fall from plants decompose and contribute to soil composition .",0
2738,"In this area , rainwater percolates through the soil and carries materials from the surface .",0
2739,"The B horizon is an accumulation of mostly fine material that has moved downward , resulting in a dense layer in the soil .",1
2740,"In some soils , the B horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate .",0
2741,"Soil bacteria , collectively called rhizobia , symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules , in which nitrogen fixation takes place .",1
2742,"This process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia , by means of the enzyme nitrogenase .",0
2743,"Therefore , using rhizobia is a natural and environmentally friendly way to fertilize plants , as opposed to chemical fertilization that uses a nonrenewable resource , such as natural gas .",0
2744,"A symbiont is a plant in a symbiotic relationship , with special adaptations such as mycorrhizae or nodule formation .",1
2745,Fungi also form symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria and green algae ( called lichens ) .,1
2746,Plants have two distinct stages in their lifecycle : the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage .,0
2747,The haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures .,1
2748,"Fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote , which develops into the sporophyte .",1
2749,The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium .,0
2750,The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia .,1
2751,"The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium , or the female reproductive component(s ) .",1
2752,"Each pollen grain has two coverings : the exine ( thicker , outer layer ) and the intine ( [ link ] ) .",0
2753,"The exine contains sporopollenin , a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells .",1
2754,"During the second phase , megagametogenesis , the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight - nucleate , seven - cell female gametophyte , also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac . Two of the nuclei — the polar nuclei — move to the equator and fuse , forming a single , diploid central cell .",1
2755,This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm .,0
2756,The ovule wall will become part of the fruit .,0
2757,"The integuments , while protecting the megasporangium , do not enclose it completely , but leave an opening called the micropyle .",0
2758,The micropyle allows the pollen tube to enter the female gametophyte for fertilization .,1
2759,"In angiosperms , pollination is defined as the placement or transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower .",1
2760,"In gymnosperms , pollination involves pollen transfer from the male cone to the female cone .",1
2761,"They visit flowers that are open during the day , are brightly colored , have a strong aroma or scent , and have a tubular shape , typically with the presence of a nectar guide .",0
2762,"A nectar guide includes regions on the flower petals that are visible only to bees , and not to humans ; it helps to guide bees to the center of the flower , thus making the pollination process more efficient .",1
2763,"The pollen sticks to the bees’ fuzzy hair , and when the bee visits another flower , some of the pollen is transferred to the second flower .",0
2764,"After fertilization , the zygote divides to form two cells : the upper cell , or terminal cell , and the lower , or basal , cell .",0
2765,"The division of the basal cell gives rise to the suspensor , which eventually makes connection with the maternal tissue .",0
2766,The suspensor provides a route for nutrition to be transported from the mother plant to the growing embryo .,1
2767,Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm .,0
2768,"Upon germination , enzymes are secreted by the aleurone , a single layer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the endosperm and embryo .",1
2769,"The enzymes degrade the stored carbohydrates , proteins and lipids , the products of which are absorbed by the scutellum and transported via a vasculature strand to the developing embryo .",0
2770,"The seed , along with the ovule , is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac .",0
2771,"In dicots , the seed coat is further divided into an outer coat known as the testa and inner coat known as the tegmen .",1
2772,"In monocots , the hypocotyl does not show above ground because monocots do not exhibit stem elongation .",0
2773,The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl .,1
2774,"The plumule is composed of the epicotyl , young leaves , and the shoot apical meristem . Upon germination in dicot seeds , the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards .",1
2775,"In many seeds , the presence of a thick seed coat retards the ability to germinate .",0
2776,"Scarification , which includes mechanical or chemical processes to soften the seed coat , is often employed before germination .",1
2777,"Presoaking in hot water , or passing through an acid environment , such as an animal ’s digestive tract , may also be employed .",0
2778,"An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .",1
2779,Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers .,1
2780,"An example is the pineapple , where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit .",0
2781,"Fruits generally have three parts : the exocarp ( the outermost skin or covering ) , the mesocarp ( middle part of the fruit ) , and the endocarp ( the inner part of the fruit ) .",1
2782,"Together , all three are known as the pericarp .",0
2783,"The mesocarp is usually the fleshy , edible part of the fruit ; however , in some fruits , such as the almond , the endocarp is the edible part .",0
2784,"In grafting , two plant species are used ; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock .",1
2785,The part that is grafted or attached is called the scion .,1
2786,"Both are cut at an oblique angle ( any angle other than a right angle ) , placed in close contact with each other , and are then held together [ link ] .",1
2787,Micropropagation ( also called plant tissue culture ) is a method of propagating a large number of plants from a single plant in a short time under laboratory conditions [ link ] .,1
2788,"This method allows propagation of rare , endangered species that may be difficult to grow under natural conditions , are economically important , or are in demand as disease - free plants .",0
2789,"The aging of a plant and all the associated processes is known as senescence , which is marked by several complex biochemical changes .",1
2790,"One of the characteristics of senescence is the breakdown of chloroplasts , which is characterized by the yellowing of leaves .",0
2791,This is fused to the animal ’s epidermis .,0
2792,"Ingrowths of the exoskeleton , called apodemes , function as attachment sites for muscles , similar to tendons in more advanced animals ( [ link ] ) .",1
2793,"In order to grow , the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed or molt the original covering .",0
2794,"Carbohydrates and proteins contain about 4.5 to 5 kcal / g , and fat contains about 9 kcal / g .",0
2795,Metabolic rate is estimated as the basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) in endothermic animals at rest and as the standard metabolic rate ( SMR ) in ectotherms .,1
2796,"Human males have a BMR of 1600 to 1800 kcal / day , and human females have a BMR of 1300 to 1500 kcal / day .",0
2797,"Torpor can be used by animals for long periods , such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months , in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature .",0
2798,"During hibernation , ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) , while a bear ’s internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37 ° C ( 99 ° F).If torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water , it is called estivation .",1
2799,Some desert animals use this to survive the harshest months of the year .,0
2800,"A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .",1
2801,A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .,1
2802,"A transverse plane ( or , horizontal plane ) divides the animal into upper and lower portions .",1
2803,The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral ( or spinal ) cavities .,1
2804,"The ventral cavity contains the thoracic cavity , which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial cavity , which surrounds the heart .",1
2805,"The ventral cavity also contains the abdominopelvic cavity , which can be separated into the abdominal and the pelvic cavities .",0
2806,"Squamous epithelial cells are generally round , flat , and have a small , centrally located nucleus .",0
2807,"The cell outline is slightly irregular , and cells fit together to form a covering or lining .",0
2808,"The nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells , making it appear as though there is more than one layer , as seen in [ link ] .",1
2809,"This is called pseudostratified , columnar epithelia .",0
2810,"This cellular covering has cilia at the apical , or free , surface of the cells .",1
2811,Some tissues have specialized cells that are not found in the others .,0
2812,The matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density .,0
2813,"When a connective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers , it has proportionally a less dense matrix .",0
2814,Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers .,1
2815,"The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .",1
2816,"Compact bone is found in the shaft ( or diaphysis ) of a long bone and the surface of the flat bones , while spongy bone is found in the end ( or epiphysis ) of a long bone .",1
2817,"Compact bone is organized into subunits called osteons , as illustrated in [ link ] .",1
2818,"A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the Haversian canal , with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae .",1
2819,These changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external temperatures .,0
2820,Homeostasis means to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body .,1
2821,It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the body ’s systems encounter .,0
2822,"Positive Feedback LoopA positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus , possibly accelerating it .",1
2823,"Few examples of positive feedback loops exist in animal bodies , but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting , or coagulation .",1
2824,Omnivores are animals that eat both plant- and animal - derived food .,1
2825,"In Latin , omnivore means to eat everything .",0
2826,"As the word monogastric suggests , this type of digestive system consists of one ( “ mono ” ) stomach chamber ( “ gastric ” ) .",1
2827,Humans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in [ link]ab .,0
2828,"Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes , which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria .",0
2829,Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose .,1
2830,Another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue .,0
2831,The esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach .,1
2832,The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed .,0
2833,"The large intestine , illustrated in [ link ] , reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste material .",1
2834,The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter .,0
2835,The liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying blood .,1
2836,"The liver produces bile , a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fatty components of the food in the duodenum .",1
2837,"Essential NutrientsWhile the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors , there are some nutrients that need to be consumed from food .",1
2838,"These nutrients are termed essential nutrients , meaning they must be eaten , and the body can not produce them .",0
2839,Food needs to be broken into smaller particles so that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules .,0
2840,The first step in this process is ingestion .,0
2841,Ingestion is the process of taking in food through the mouth .,1
2842,"The enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the digestion of proteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides , which are short chains of four to nine amino acids .",1
2843,"In the duodenum , other enzymes — trypsin , elastase , and chymotrypsin — act on the peptides reducing them to smaller peptides .",0
2844,"Trypsin elastase , carboxypeptidase , and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where they act on the chyme .",0
2845,The response to food begins even before food enters the mouth .,0
2846,"The first phase of ingestion , called the cephalic phase , is controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food .",1
2847,"All aspects — such as sight , sense , and smell — trigger the neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices .",0
2848,The endocrine system controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate times .,1
2849,"In the duodenum , digestive secretions from the liver , pancreas , and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme during the intestinal phase .",0
2850,"In order to neutralize the acidic chyme , a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum .",1
2851,Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin ( CCK ) .,0
2852,"The nervous system is made up of neurons , specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals , and glia , cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to neurons .",1
2853,A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire — it transmits a signal from one place to another .,0
2854,"The cell body contains a specialized structure , the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon .",1
2855,An axon is a tube - like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals .,1
2856,"These terminals in turn synapse on other neurons , muscle , or target organs .",0
2857,"There are several different types of glia with different functions , two of which are shown in [ link ] .",0
2858,"Astrocytes , shown in [ link]a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS .",1
2859,"They provide nutrients and other substances to neurons , regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid , and provide structural support for synapses .",0
2860,Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .,1
2861,"Oligodendrocytes , shown in [ link]b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS .",1
2862,"One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes , and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons .",0
2863,Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .,0
2864,Ependymal cells line fluid - filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord .,1
2865,"They are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid , which serves as a cushion for the brain , moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain , and is a component for the choroid plexus . Glial cells support neurons and maintain their environment .",0
2866,"When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’s dendrites , ion channels open .",0
2867,"At excitatory synapses , this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane — a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron .",0
2868,A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential ( -55 mV ) .,0
2869,"Flow of ions through these channels , particularly the Na+ channels , regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon .",1
2870,This ‘ jumping’ of the action potential from one node to the next is called saltatory conduction .,0
2871,"If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon , the action potential would propagate very slowly since Na+ and K+ channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon instead of at specific points .",0
2872,Na+ enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize .,1
2873,This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential .,0
2874,"Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane .",1
2875,Long - term potentiation ( LTP ) is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection .,1
2876,LTP is based on the Hebbian principle : cells that fire together wire together .,0
2877,"The central nervous system ( CNS ) is made up of the brain , a part of which is shown in [ link ] and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges ( from the Greek word for membrane ) .",1
2878,The outermost layer is the dura mater ( Latin for “ hard mother ” ) .,0
2879,"As the Latin suggests , the primary function for this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal cord .",1
2880,"The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .",1
2881,The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .,0
2882,CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid - filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles .,0
2883,The cortex is made up of two hemispheres — right and left — which are separated by a large sulcus .,0
2884,A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum ( Latin : “ tough body ” ) connects the two hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one side to the other .,1
2885,"Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other , the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant .",0
2886,Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading .,0
2887,"Two of the parietal lobe ’s main functions are processing somatosensation — touch sensations like pressure , pain , heat , cold — and processing proprioception — the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space .",0
2888,The parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex .,0
2889,The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds .,1
2890,It also contains the hippocampus ( Greek for “ seahorse”)—a structure that processes memory formation .,1
2891,The hippocampus is illustrated in [ link ] .,0
2892,"Below the thalamus is the hypothalamus , shown in [ link ] .",0
2893,"The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to the pituitary gland , a pea - sized endocrine gland that releases several different hormones that affect other glands as well as other cells .",1
2894,The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces .,0
2895,The cingulate gyrus helps regulate emotions and pain .,1
2896,"Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord , shown in [ link ] .",0
2897,The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body .,1
2898,"Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
2899,The axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia ( the sympathetic ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord ) .,0
2900,The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons .,0
2901,"Humans have 12 cranial nerves , nerves that emerge from or enter the skull ( cranium ) , as opposed to the spinal nerves , which emerge from the vertebral column .",1
2902,"Each cranial nerve is accorded a name , which are detailed in [ link ] .",0
2903,Alzheimer ’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly .,0
2904,"In 2012 , an estimated 5.4 million Americans suffered from Alzheimer ’s disease , and payments for their care are estimated at $ 200 billion .",0
2905,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD)Approximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .,0
2906,"Like ASD , ADHD is more prevalent in males than females .",0
2907,Estimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the United States will be diagnosed with epilepsy in their lifetime .,0
2908,"While there are several different types of epilepsy , all are characterized by recurrent seizures .",0
2909,This process is called sensory transduction . There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction .,0
2910,"In one , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus .",0
2911,"Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron , which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system .",0
2912,The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system .,0
2913,"This takes place at the sensory receptor , and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the receptor potential .",1
2914,"How is sensory input , such as pressure on the skin , changed to a receptor potential ?",0
2915,"Mechanoreceptors in the skin are described as encapsulated ( that is , surrounded by a capsule ) or unencapsulated ( a group that includes free nerve endings ) .",1
2916,"A free nerve ending , as its name implies , is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron .",1
2917,"Free nerve endings are the most common nerve endings in skin , and they extend into the middle of the epidermis .",0
2918,"Deeper in the epidermis , near the base , are Ruffini endings , which are also known as bulbous corpuscles .",0
2919,They are found in both glabrous and hairy skin .,0
2920,"Once in the medulla , the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus . Muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch , or lengthening of muscles .",0
2921,"Related to these are Golgi tendon organs , which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction .",1
2922,Proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals come from limbs .,0
2923,"Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz ; cats , 60,000 Hz ; bats , 100,000 Hz ; and dolphins 150,000 Hz , and American shad ( Alosa sapidissima ) , a fish , can hear 180,000 Hz .",0
2924,"Those frequencies above the human range are called ultrasound . Amplitude , or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough , in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in [ link ] .",1
2925,The sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds .,0
2926,Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .,0
2927,"The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .",1
2928,"The three ossicles are the malleus ( also known as the hammer ) , the incus ( the anvil ) , and stapes ( the stirrup ) .",0
2929,"The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window , which is the outermost structure of the inner ear .",1
2930,"The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth , a bony , hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear .",1
2931,"Here , the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea .",0
2932,"When the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar membrane , it flexes back and forth in a wave - like fashion .",0
2933,Above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane .,0
2934,The fluid - filled semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles .,0
2935,They are arranged in three spatial planes .,0
2936,"The photoreceptive cells of the eye , where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs , are located in the retina ( shown in [ link ] ) on the inner surface of the back of the eye .",1
2937,But light does not impinge on the retina unaltered .,0
2938,"The lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat or allow it to thicken , changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina .",0
2939,"With age comes the loss of the flexibility of the lens , and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results .",0
2940,Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina .,0
2941,"There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina : rods and cones , named for their general appearance as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
2942,Rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina .,1
2943,Photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity .,0
2944,"That is , they are always slightly active even when not stimulated by light .",1
2945,"Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .",0
2946,"The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body ’s internal clock , which controls our circadian ( day - long ) cycle .",1
2947,"The SCN sends information to the pineal gland , which is important in sleep / wake patterns and annual cycles .",0
2948,"Odorants ( odor molecules ) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium , the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .",1
2949,The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans .,1
2950,Olfactory neurons are bipolar neurons ( neurons with two processes from the cell body ) .,1
2951,"Each neuron has a single dendrite buried in the olfactory epithelium , and extending from this dendrite are 5 to 20 receptor - laden , hair - like cilia that trap odorant molecules .",0
2952,These are elongated cells with hair - like processes called microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore ( illustrate in [ link ] ) .,0
2953,"Food molecules ( tastants ) are dissolved in saliva , and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli .",1
2954,"The receptors for tastants are located across the outer portion and front of the tongue , outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent .",0
2955,"Chemically , these hormones are usually ketones or alcohols ; their chemical names will end in “ -ol ” for alcohols or “ -one ” for ketones .",0
2956,"Examples of steroid hormones include estradiol , which is an estrogen , or female sex hormone , and testosterone , which is an androgen , or male sex hormone .",1
2957,"These two hormones are released by the female and male reproductive organs , respectively .",0
2958,Hormones mediate changes in target cells by binding to specific hormone receptors .,0
2959,"In this way , even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types , they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors .",0
2960,Receptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes .,0
2961,"Depending on the location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone , hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene transcription , or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways .",0
2962,One very important second messenger is cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) .,0
2963,"When a hormone binds to its membrane receptor , a G - protein that is associated with the receptor is activated ; G - proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in the cell membrane .",1
2964,"When a hormone is not bound to the receptor , the G - protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine diphosphate , or GDP .",0
2965,"The term “ humoral ” is derived from the term “ humor , ” which refers to bodily fluids such as blood .",1
2966,A humoral stimulus refers to the control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration in the blood .,1
2967,"For example , a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin .",0
2968,"Because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones , the nervous and endocrine systems work in a coordinated manner to regulate the body 's physiology .",0
2969,Hypothalamic - Pituitary AxisThe hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems .,0
2970,The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain .,1
2971,"The anterior pituitary gland , or adenohypophysis , is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus , down along the infundibulum , and to the anterior pituitary .",1
2972,This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system .,1
2973,"The thyroid gland is located in the neck , just below the larynx and in front of the trachea , as shown in [ link ] .",0
2974,It is a butterfly - shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus .,0
2975,"Follicle cells are stimulated to release stored T3 and T4 by thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary .",0
2976,"These thyroid hormones increase the rates of mitochondrial ATP production . A third hormone , calcitonin , is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid either releasing hormones or inhibiting hormones .",0
2977,"Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt , and even smaller particles , less than 0.002 mm in diameter , are called clay .",1
2978,"Some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand , silt , and humus ; these soils are called loams .",1
2979,The organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material .,1
2980,"Mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock , the solid rock that lies beneath the soil , and therefore , they have a similar composition to the original rock .",1
2981,"The soil profile has four distinct layers : 1 ) O horizon ; 2 ) A horizon ; 3 ) B horizon , or subsoil ; and 4 ) C horizon , or soil base ( [ link ] ) .",1
2982,"The O horizon has freshly decomposing organic matter — humus — at its surface , with decomposed vegetation at its base .",1
2983,Humus enriches the soil with nutrients and enhances soil moisture retention .,0
2984,A parasitic plant depends on its host for survival .,0
2985,Some parasitic plants have no leaves .,0
2986,"An epiphyte is a plant that grows on other plants , but is not dependent upon the other plant for nutrition ( [ link ] ) .",1
2987,"Epiphytes have two types of roots : clinging aerial roots , which absorb nutrients from humus that accumulates in the crevices of trees ; and aerial roots , which absorb moisture from the atmosphere .",1
2988,The haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures .,0
2989,"Fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote , which develops into the sporophyte .",0
2990,"After reaching maturity , the diploid sporophyte produces spores by meiosis , which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid gametophyte .",0
2991,The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia .,0
2992,"The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium , or the female reproductive component(s ) .",1
2993,"The carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma , style , and ovary .",1
2994,"Female Gametophyte ( The Embryo Sac)While the details may vary between species , the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases .",0
2995,"First , in the process of megasporogenesis , a single cell in the diploid megasporangium — an area of tissue in the ovules — undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores , only one of which survives .",1
2996,"During the second phase , megagametogenesis , the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight - nucleate , seven - cell female gametophyte , also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac .",1
2997,This central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm .,0
2998,"Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells , which later degenerate .",0
2999,"The nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete , or egg cell , and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells ( [ link ] ) .",0
3000,"Male GametophyteA male cone has a central axis on which bracts , a type of modified leaf , are attached .",0
3001,The bracts are known as microsporophylls ( [ link ] ) and are the sites where microspores will develop .,1
3002,The microspores develop inside the microsporangium .,0
3003,Pollination takes two forms : self - pollination and cross - pollination .,0
3004,"Self - pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower , or another flower on the same plant .",1
3005,Cross - pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species .,1
3006,"The pollen tube is guided by the chemicals secreted by the synergids present in the embryo sac , and it enters the ovule sac through the micropyle .",0
3007,"Of the two sperm cells , one sperm fertilizes the egg cell , forming a diploid zygote ; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm .",1
3008,"Together , these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization ( [ link ] ) .",0
3009,"The terminal cell also divides , giving rise to a globular - shaped proembryo ( [ link]a ) .",0
3010,"In dicots ( eudicots ) , the developing embryo has a heart shape , due to the presence of the two rudimentary cotyledons ( [ link]b ) .",1
3011,"In non - endospermic dicots , such as Capsella bursa , the endosperm develops initially , but is then digested , and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons .",1
3012,The two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo .,0
3013,"In endospermic dicots , the food reserves are stored in the endosperm .",0
3014,"During germination , the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive organs to take up the enzymatically released food reserves , much like in monocots ( monocots , by definition , also have endospermic seeds ) .",0
3015,"The embryonic axis consists of three parts : the plumule , the radicle , and the hypocotyl .",1
3016,The portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl ( hypocotyl means “ below the cotyledons ” ) .,1
3017,"The embryonic axis terminates in a radicle ( the embryonic root ) , which is the region from which the root will develop .",1
3018,The part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl .,1
3019,"The plumule is composed of the epicotyl , young leaves , and the shoot apical meristem . Upon germination in dicot seeds , the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards .",1
3020,"This shape is called the plumule hook , and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark .",0
3021,"Many mature seeds enter a period of inactivity , or extremely low metabolic activity : a process known as dormancy , which may last for months , years or even centuries .",1
3022,Dormancy helps keep seeds viable during unfavorable conditions .,0
3023,"Fruits may be classified as simple , aggregate , multiple , or accessory , depending on their origin ( [ link ] ) .",0
3024,"If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary , it is known as a simple fruit , as seen in nuts and beans .",1
3025,"An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .",1
3026,"An example is the pineapple , where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit .",0
3027,"Accessory fruits ( sometimes called false fruits ) are not derived from the ovary , but from another part of the flower , such as the receptacle ( strawberry ) or the hypanthium ( apples and pears ) .",1
3028,"Either the ovule or part of the ovary , which is diploid in nature , gives rise to a new seed .",1
3029,This method of reproduction is known as apomixis .,0
3030,"Plants such as coleus and money plant are propagated through stem cuttings , where a portion of the stem containing nodes and internodes is placed in moist soil and allowed to root .",1
3031,"In some species , stems can start producing a root even when placed only in water .",0
3032,"In another classification based on flowering frequency , monocarpic plants flower only once in their lifetime ; examples include bamboo and yucca .",1
3033,"During the vegetative period of their life cycle ( which may be as long as 120 years in some bamboo species ) , these plants may reproduce asexually and accumulate a great deal of food material that will be required during their once - in - a - lifetime flowering and setting of seed after fertilization .",0
3034,"They are asymmetrical , radial , or bilateral in form as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
3035,Asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry ; an example of an asymmetrical animal is a sponge .,1
3036,"Radial symmetry , as illustrated in [ link ] , describes when an animal has an up - and - down orientation : any plane cut along its longitudinal axis through the organism produces equal halves , but not a definite right or left side .",1
3037,"No energy system is one hundred percent efficient , and an animal ’s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat .",0
3038,"If an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature , it is classified as a warm - blooded animal and called an endotherm .",1
3039,"The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur , fat , or feathers .",0
3040,Animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor .,0
3041,Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions .,1
3042,"Torpor can be used by animals for long periods , such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months , in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature .",0
3043,A standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes .,0
3044,A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions .,1
3045,"A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .",1
3046,A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .,1
3047,"A transverse plane ( or , horizontal plane ) divides the animal into upper and lower portions .",1
3048,"This is sometimes called a cross section , and , if the transverse cut is at an angle , it is called an oblique plane .",1
3049,Epithelial TissuesEpithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer or multiple layers of cells .,1
3050,The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells .,0
3051,"Cuboidal epithelial cells , shown in [ link ] , are cube - shaped with a single , central nucleus .",1
3052,They are most commonly found in a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where they prepare and secrete glandular material .,0
3053,"Transitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system , primarily in the bladder and ureter .",1
3054,"These cells are arranged in a stratified layer , but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed , empty bladder , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
3055,"Loose connective tissue , also called areolar connective tissue , has a sampling of all of the components of a connective tissue .",1
3056,"As illustrated in [ link ] , loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts ; macrophages are present as well .",0
3057,Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers .,1
3058,"The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .",1
3059,Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae .,1
3060,"A blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the Haversian canal , with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae .",1
3061,The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi ; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells .,1
3062,Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength .,1
3063,The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point .,1
3064,"While there are normal fluctuations from the set point , the body ’s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point .",0
3065,Medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level .,0
3066,This is called a process of alteration of the set point in a feedback loop .,0
3067,Herbivores are animals whose primary food source is plant - based .,1
3068,"Examples of herbivores , as shown in [ link ] include vertebrates like deer , koalas , and some bird species , as well as invertebrates such as crickets and caterpillars .",0
3069,"Because most birds fly , their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low .",0
3070,"The stomach of birds has two chambers : the proventriculus , where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach , and the gizzard , where the food is stored , soaked , and mechanically ground .",1
3071,The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated .,0
3072,Saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose .,1
3073,Another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue .,1
3074,Lipases are a class of enzymes that can break down triglycerides .,0
3075,The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed .,0
3076,"The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series of wave like movements called peristalsis that push the food toward the stomach , as illustrated in [ link ] .",1
3077,"The peristalsis wave is unidirectional — it moves food from the mouth to the stomach , and reverse movement is not possible .",0
3078,Protein digestion is mediated by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber .,0
3079,Pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called pepsinogen .,1
3080,"Pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides ; it also helps activate more pepsinogen , starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin .",0
3081,"The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein , fats , and carbohydrates is completed .",1
3082,The small intestine is a long tube - like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger - like projections called the villi .,1
3083,The apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli .,1
3084,"The rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine , as shown in [ link ] .",1
3085,The primary role of the rectum is to store the feces until defecation .,0
3086,The pancreas is another important gland that secretes digestive juices .,0
3087,"The chyme produced from the stomach is highly acidic in nature ; the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate , an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme .",1
3088,The omega-3 alpha - linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane phospholipids .,0
3089,"Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many enzymes to function and , for this reason , are considered to be co - enzymes .",1
3090,"Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health , as outlined in [ link ] and [ link ] .",0
3091,Digestion and AbsorptionDigestion is the mechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments .,1
3092,It is important to break down macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium .,0
3093,Further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases ( those that break down peptides ) .,1
3094,"Specifically , carboxypeptidase , dipeptidase , and aminopeptidase play important roles in reducing the peptides to free amino acids .",0
3095,The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestines .,0
3096,The gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach .,1
3097,It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase .,0
3098,One of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment .,0
3099,"During the gastric phase , the hormone gastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins .",0
3100,"Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid , or hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) which aids in the digestion of the proteins .",0
3101,"In order to neutralize the acidic chyme , a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum .",1
3102,Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin ( CCK ) .,0
3103,"Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices , it also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum .",1
3104,"Neurons also contain unique structures , illustrated in [ link ] for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible .",0
3105,Dendrites are tree - like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses .,1
3106,"Although some neurons do not have any dendrites , some types of neurons have multiple dendrites .",0
3107,"Neurons usually have one or two axons , but some neurons , like amacrine cells in the retina , do not contain any axons .",0
3108,"Some axons are covered with myelin , which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon , greatly increasing the speed on conduction .",1
3109,This insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter — from the base of the spine to the toes .,0
3110,"Astrocytes , in particular , have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity , transmit calcium waves between astrocytes , and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses .",0
3111,Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS .,1
3112,Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .,1
3113,"One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes , and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons .",0
3114,This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon .,0
3115,Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .,1
3116,Voltage - gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell .,0
3117,The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential .,1
3118,"To accomplish this , the Na+ channels close and can not be opened .",0
3119,"This begins the neuron 's refractory period , in which it can not produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open .",0
3120,"At the same time , voltage - gated K+ channels open , allowing K+ to leave the cell .",0
3121,This depolarization causes voltage - gated Ca2 + channels to open .,0
3122,"Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes small membrane - bound vesicles , called synaptic vesicles , containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane .",0
3123,"Synaptic vesicles are shown in [ link ] , which is an image from a scanning electron microscope .",0
3124,This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential .,0
3125,"Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane .",1
3126,"For example , when the neurotransmitter GABA ( gamma - aminobutyric acid ) is released from a presynaptic neuron , it binds to and opens Cl- channels .",0
3127,Long - term depression ( LTD ) is essentially the reverse of LTP : it is a long - term weakening of a synaptic connection .,1
3128,One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors .,0
3129,The dura mater also contains vein - like structures that carry blood from the brain back to the heart .,0
3130,The middle layer is the web - like arachnoid mater .,0
3131,"The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .",1
3132,The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .,0
3133,CSF is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid - filled compartments in the CNS called ventricles .,1
3134,"The brain floats in CSF , which acts as a cushion and shock absorber and makes the brain neutrally buoyant .",0
3135,"The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain , over the eyes .",1
3136,"This lobe contains the olfactory bulb , which processes smells .",0
3137,The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain .,1
3138,"It is primarily involved in vision — seeing , recognizing , and identifying the visual world .",0
3139,"Interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia ( or basal nuclei ) , shown in [ link]b , play important roles in movement control and posture .",1
3140,"Damage to the basal ganglia , as in Parkinson ’s disease , leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait when walking .",0
3141,"The limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion , as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation .",1
3142,It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus .,0
3143,"The cerebellum ( Latin for “ little brain ” ) , shown in [ link ] , sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem .",1
3144,The cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks .,0
3145,"The PNS can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system , which controls bodily functions without conscious control , and the sensory - somatic nervous system , which transmits sensory information from the skin , muscles , and sensory organs to the CNS and sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles .",1
3146,The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons .,1
3147,Postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs .,1
3148,"As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test , speech , or athletic event can attest , the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive .",0
3149,Spinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body .,1
3150,Each of the 31 spinal nerves ( in humans ) contains both sensory and motor axons .,0
3151,"Like Alzheimer ’s disease , Parkinson ’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease .",1
3152,It was first characterized by James Parkinson in 1817 .,0
3153,Schizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the United States .,0
3154,"Symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination , inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses , difficulty thinking , and problems with social situations .",0
3155,"Additionally , we possess general senses , also called somatosensation , which respond to stimuli like temperature , pain , pressure , and vibration .",1
3156,"Vestibular sensation , which is an organism ’s sense of spatial orientation and balance , proprioception ( position of bones , joints , and muscles ) , and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia ( limb movement ) are part of somatosensation .",1
3157,"Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system .",0
3158,"The first step in sensation is reception , which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli ( being bent or squished , for example ) , chemicals , or temperature .",1
3159,The receptor can then respond to the stimuli .,0
3160,"How is sensory input , such as pressure on the skin , changed to a receptor potential ?",0
3161,"In this example , a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor ( as shown in [ link ] ) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure .",1
3162,"Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron , changing its electrical potential .",0
3163,"A fifth type of mechanoreceptor , Krause end bulbs , are found only in specialized regions .",0
3164,"Merkel ’s disks ( shown in [ link ] ) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis , both in skin that has hair and on glabrous skin , that is , the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers , the soles of the feet , and the lips of humans and other primates .",1
3165,Merkel ’s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips .,0
3166,Note that these warmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors .,0
3167,"It is not surprising , then , that humans detect cold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli . Pacinian corpuscles ( seen in [ link ] ) are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are structurally similar to Meissner ’s corpuscles ; they are found in the bone periosteum , joint capsules , pancreas and other viscera , breast , and genitals .",1
3168,They are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient ( but not prolonged ) pressure and high - frequency vibration .,0
3169,"Pain is the name given to nociception , which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage .",1
3170,"Pain is caused by true sources of injury , such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive chemical .",0
3171,"In mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna , then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum , the innermost part of the outer ear ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .",1
3172,Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .,1
3173,"The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .",1
3174,"The three ossicles are the malleus ( also known as the hammer ) , the incus ( the anvil ) , and stapes ( the stirrup ) .",0
3175,The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup .,0
3176,The vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid ( perilymph ) inside the cochlea .,0
3177,"The cochlea is a whorled structure , like the shell of a snail , and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .",1
3178,"Inside the cochlea , the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea , curling toward the cochlea ’s center .",1
3179,The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti ( spiral organ ) .,0
3180,"It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil , with their exposed short , hair - like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them .",1
3181,Vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images .,1
3182,"Animals are bombarded with sensory information , and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic .",0
3183,It passes through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina ( [ link]b ) .,0
3184,"The cornea , the front transparent layer of the eye , and the crystalline lens , a transparent convex structure behind the cornea , both refract ( bend ) light to focus the image on the retina .",1
3185,"The iris , which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye , is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye .",1
3186,Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina .,0
3187,Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short .,1
3188,"For both defects , images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry .",0
3189,The fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision .,1
3190,The fovea has a high density of cones .,0
3191,"Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain , where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information .",1
3192,"Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .",0
3193,"Taste , also called gustation , and smell , also called olfaction , are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors .",1
3194,"Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other animals — whether potential mates , predators , or prey — or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival .",0
3195,"Odorants ( odor molecules ) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium , the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .",1
3196,The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans .,1
3197,Recall that sensory cells are neurons .,0
3198,PheromonesA pheromone is a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals of the same species .,1
3199,"Pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them , but pheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors .",0
3200,"Olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin , unmyelinated axons .",1
3201,"The olfactory bulb is composed of neural clusters called glomeruli , and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor , so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant .",1
3202,"From glomeruli , olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus .",0
3203,"The amino acid - derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan , shown in [ link ] .",1
3204,"If a hormone is amino acid - derived , its chemical name will end in “ -ine ” .",0
3205,"Additionally , the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time , resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity .",0
3206,"In up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity .",1
3207,"When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced .",1
3208,Amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid - derived ( lipid - soluble ) and therefore can not diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells .,0
3209,"Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane , via plasma membrane hormone receptors .",1
3210,"Unlike steroid hormones , lipid insoluble hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they can not enter the cell and act directly on DNA .",0
3211,"When a hormone binds to the receptor , the G - protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate , or GTP , in place of GDP .",0
3212,"After binding , GTP is hydrolysed by the G - protein into GDP and becomes inactive . The activated G - protein in turn activates a membrane - bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase .",0
3213,Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP .,1
3214,Hormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone .,1
3215,A number of endocrine glands release hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands .,0
3216,It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland .,0
3217,"The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control . The pituitary gland , sometimes called the hypophysis or “ master gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica , a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] .",1
3218,It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk ( or infundibulum ) .,0
3219,"The anterior pituitary gland , or adenohypophysis , is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus , down along the infundibulum , and to the anterior pituitary .",1
3220,This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system .,1
3221,"A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another ; therefore , the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system . The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones : growth hormone ( GH ) , prolactin ( PRL ) , thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , melanin - stimulating hormone ( MSH ) , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) .",1
3222,"The thyroid gland is located in the neck , just below the larynx and in front of the trachea , as shown in [ link ] .",1
3223,It is a butterfly - shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus .,0
3224,It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular system .,0
3225,"Most people have four parathyroid glands ; however , the number can vary from two to six .",0
3226,"So the domestic and foreign policy realms are intertwined in terms of what we view as national priorities — whether they consist of nation building abroad or infrastructure building here at home , for example .",0
3227,This latter choice is often described as the “ guns versus butter ” debate .,0
3228,International agreements represent another of the broad - based foreign policy instruments .,0
3229,The United States finds it useful to enter into international agreements with other countries for a variety of reasons and on a variety of different subjects .,0
3230,These agreements run the gamut from bilateral agreements about tariffs to multinational agreements among dozens of countries about the treatment of prisoners of war .,0
3231,"Ann Arbor , MI : University of Michigan Press .",0
3232,"Executive agreements are negotiated by the president , and in the case of sole executive agreements , they are simultaneously approved by the president as well .",1
3233,"On the other hand , congressional - executive agreements , like the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , are negotiated by the president and then approved by a simple majority of the House and Senate ( rather than a two - thirds vote in the Senate as is the case for a treaty ) .",1
3234,"In the key case of United States v. Pink ( 1942 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that executive agreements were legally equivalent to treaties provided they did not alter federal law . United States v. Pink , 315 U.S. 203 ( 1942 ) .",1
3235,"Most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not spark controversy , while some , like the Iran Nuclear Agreement , generate considerable debate .",0
3236,"Should new international agreements into which the United States enters be forged through the Article II treaty process of the U.S. Constitution , or through executive agreements ?",0
3237,This question arose again in 2015 as the Iran Nuclear Agreement was being completed .,0
3238,"That pact required Iran to halt further nuclear development and agree to nuclear inspections , while the United States and five other signatories lifted long - standing economic sanctions on Iran .",1
3239,"As the date indicates , it was taken on the last day of the Cuban Missile Crisis .",0

3242,"While there has sometimes been criticism , Congress has never acted to reverse presidential action .",0
3243,"As discussed above , the War Powers Resolution clarified that the first step in the use of force was the president ’s , for the first sixty days .",0
3244,"A recent example of the military use of force was the U.S. role in enforcing a no - fly zone over Libya in 2011 , which included kinetic strikes — or active engagement of the enemy — to protect anti - government forces on the ground .",1
3245,This dual domestic and international role has been described by the two presidencies thesis .,0
3246,"This theory originated with University of California – Berkeley professor Aaron Wildavsky and suggests that there are two distinct presidencies , one for foreign policy and one for domestic policy , and that presidents are more successful in foreign than domestic policy .",0
3247,Let ’s look at the reasoning behind this thesis .,0
3248,"While the president still has stronger foreign policy powers than domestic powers , the governing context has changed in two key ways .",0
3249,"First , the Cold War ended in 1989 with the demolition of the Berlin Wall , the subsequent disintegration of the Soviet Union , and the eventual opening up of Eastern European territories to independence and democracy .",0
3250,"These dramatic changes removed the competitive superpower aspect of the Cold War , in which the United States and the USSR were dueling rivals on the world stage .",0
3251,The White House staff members engaged in foreign policy are likely to have very regular contact with the president about their work .,0
3252,"The national security advisor heads the president ’s National Security Council , a group of senior - level staff from multiple foreign policy agencies , and is generally the president ’s top foreign policy advisor . Also reporting to the president in the White House is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .",1
3253,"In March 2011 , then - secretary of defense Robert Gates ( left ) held talks with Afghan president Hamid Karzai in Kabul , Afghanistan .",0

3255,The end of the Cold War opened up old wounds as a variety of smaller European countries sought independence and old ethnic conflicts reappeared .,0
3256,"Some in the United States felt the country should again be isolationist as the world settled into a new political arrangement , including a vocal senator , Jesse Helms ( R - NC ) , who was against the United States continuing to be the military “ policeman ” of the world .",0
3257,At the other end of the spectrum is liberal internationalism .,0
3258,Liberal internationalism advocates a foreign policy approach in which the United States becomes proactively engaged in world affairs .,1
3259,Two particular events in foreign policy caused many to change their views about the proper approach to U.S. involvement in world affairs .,0
3260,"First , the debacle of U.S. involvement in the civil war in Vietnam in the years leading up to 1973 caused many to rethink the country ’s traditional containment approach to the Cold War .",0
3261,Containment was the U.S. foreign policy goal of limiting the spread of communism .,0
3262,"Foreign markets beckon , tourism helps spur economic development at home and abroad , and global environmental challenges require cross - national conversation .",0
3263,"In the twenty - first century , neo - isolationism means distancing the United States from the United Nations and other international organizations that get in the way .",1
3264,The strategy of selective engagement — retaining a strong military presence and remaining engaged across the world through alliances and formal installations — is used to protect the national security interests of the United States .,1
3265,"With freedoms can come conflict , and there has been much of that in these fledgling countries as opposition coalitions debate how the future course should be charted , and by whom .",0
3266,"Under President Vladimir Putin , Russia is again trying to strengthen its power on the country ’s western border , testing expansionism while invoking Russian nationalism .",0
3267,The United States is adopting a defensive position and trying to prevent the spread of Russian influence .,0

3299,The format that an international agreement takes has been the point of considerable discussion in recent years .,0
3300,The U.S. Constitution outlines the treaty process in Article II .,0
3301,"The president negotiates a treaty , the Senate consents to the treaty by a two - thirds vote , and finally the president ratifies it .",0

3304,"Most executive agreements are not of major importance and do not spark controversy , while some , like the Iran Nuclear Agreement , generate considerable debate .",0
3305,Many in the Senate thought the Iran deal should have been completed as a treaty rather than as a sole executive agreement .,0
3306,"Madeleine Albright ( a ) , the first female secretary of state , was nominated by President Bill Clinton and unanimously confirmed by the Senate 99–0 .",0
3307,"Colin Powell ( b ) , nominated by George W. Bush , was also unanimously confirmed .",0
3308,"These sharply focused foreign policy outputs tend to be exclusively the province of the president , including the deployment of troops and/or intelligence agents in a crisis , executive summits between the president and other heads of state on targeted matters of foreign policy , presidential use of military force , and emergency funding measures to deal with foreign policy crises .",1
3309,"These measures of foreign policy are more quickly enacted and demonstrate the “ energy and dispatch ” that Alexander Hamilton , writing in the Federalist Papers , saw as inherent in the institution of the presidency .",0
3310,"Emergency spending does involve Congress through its power of the purse , but Congress tends to give presidents what they need to deal with emergencies .",0
3311,Probably the most extreme version of this potential dynamic occurred during the Eisenhower presidency .,0
3312,"When President Dwight D. Eisenhower used too many executive agreements instead of sending key ones to the Senate as treaties , Congress reacted by considering a constitutional amendment ( the Bricker Amendment ) that would have altered the treaty process as we know it .",0

3315,"Some House and Senate members ask to serve on the foreign policy committees , such as the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , the House Foreign Affairs Committee , and the two defense committees ( [ link ] ) .",1
3316,These members might have military bases within their districts or states and hence have a constituency reason for being interested in foreign policy .,0

Also reporting to the president in the White House is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .",1
3318,"Even more important on intelligence than the CIA director is the director of national intelligence , a position created in the government reorganizations after 9/11 , who oversees the entire intelligence community in the U.S. government .",0

3420,"Besides this instance of their patriotism , before they separated , they unanimously resolved that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional , that they would purchase no more British manufactures unless it be repealed , and that they would not even admit the addresses of any gentlemen should they have the opportunity , without they determined to oppose its execution to the last extremity , if the occasion required . ” The Daughters’ non - importation movement broadened the protest against the Stamp Act , giving women a new and active role in the political dissent of the time .",0

3464,"In the case of shoes , for instance , American merchants hired one group of workers to cut soles into standardized sizes .",0
3465,Critics of industrialization blamed it for the increased concentration of wealth in the hands of the few : the factory owners made vast profits while the workers received only a small fraction of the revenue from what they produced .,0

3475,"Under the leadership of Martin Van Buren , New York ’s “ Bucktail ” Republican faction ( so named because members wore a deer ’s tail on their hats , a symbol of membership in the Tammany Society ) gained political power by cultivating loyalty to the will of the majority , not to an elite family or renowned figure .",0

3504,"The first new party , the small and politically weak Liberty Party founded in 1840 , was a single - issue party , as were many of those that followed it .",0
3505,"Its members were abolitionists who fervently believed slavery was evil and should be ended , and that this was best accomplished by political means .",0

3510,"Suddenly , a process that was extraordinarily labor - intensive when done by hand could be completed quickly and easily .",0
3511,"Southern whites frequently relied upon the idea of paternalism — the premise that white slaveholders acted in the best interests of slaves , taking responsibility for their care , feeding , discipline , and even their Christian morality — to justify the existence of slavery .",1
3512,"This grossly misrepresented the reality of slavery , which was , by any measure , a dehumanizing , traumatizing , and horrifying human disaster and crime against humanity .",0
3513,"The North also produced defenders of slavery , including Louis Agassiz , a Harvard professor of zoology and geology .",0
3514,"Agassiz helped to popularize polygenism , the idea that different human races came from separate origins .",1
3515,"According to this formulation , no single human family origin existed , and blacks made up a race wholly separate from the white race .",0
3516,The reform efforts of the antebellum era sprang from the Protestant revival fervor that found expression in what historians refer to as the Second Great Awakening .,1
3517,( The First Great Awakening of evangelical Protestantism had taken place in the 1730s and 1740s . ),0

3528,"Influenced by evangelical Protestantism , Garrison and other abolitionists believed in moral suasion , a technique of appealing to the conscience of the public , especially slaveholders .",1

3534,"In January 1854 , Douglas introduced the bill ( [ link ] ) .",0
3535,The events in Kansas served as an extreme reply to Douglas ’s proposition of popular sovereignty .,0
3536,"As the violent clashes increased , Kansas became known as “ Bleeding Kansas . ” Antislavery advocates’ use of force carved out a new direction for some who opposed slavery .",0
3537,"Distancing themselves from William Lloyd Garrison and other pacifists , Brown and fellow abolitionists believed the time had come to fight slavery with violence .",0

3539,"The “ black Republicans , ” Douglas declared , posed a dangerous threat to the Constitution .",0
3540,"In October 1859 , the radical abolitionist John Brown and eighteen armed men , both blacks and whites , attacked the federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry , Virginia .",0

3545,"General George B. McClellan , the general in chief of the army , responsible for overall control of Union land forces , proved especially reluctant to engage in battle with the Confederates .",0
3546,"In direct command of the Army of the Potomac , the Union fighting force operating outside Washington , DC , McClellan believed , incorrectly , that Confederate forces were too strong to defeat and was reluctant to risk his troops in battle .",0
3547,His cautious nature made him popular with his men but not with the president or Congress .,0
3548,"By late 1862 , the course of the war had changed to take on the characteristics of total war , in which armies attempt to demoralize the enemy by both striking military targets and disrupting their opponent ’s ability to wage war through destruction of their resources .",1
3549,"In this type of war , armies often make no distinction between civilian and military targets .",0
3550,A Union campaign to convince individuals to buy the bonds helped increase sales .,0

3556,Northern Democrats railed against Lincoln and the war .,0
3557,"Republicans labeled these vocal opponents of the President Copperheads , a term that many antiwar Democrats accepted .",0
3558,"As the anti - Lincoln poster below illustrates , his enemies tried to paint him as an untrustworthy and suspect leader ( [ link ] ) .",0
3559,"However , the proposal instantly drew fire from a larger faction of Republicans in Congress who did not want to deal moderately with the South .",1
3560,"These members of Congress , known as Radical Republicans , wanted to remake the South and punish the rebels .",0
3561,"Radical Republicans insisted on harsh terms for the defeated Confederacy and protection for former slaves , going far beyond what the president proposed .",0
3562,"However , they faced the wrath of defeated but un - reconciled southerners who were determined to keep blacks an impoverished and despised underclass .",0
3563,"Recognizing the widespread devastation in the South and the dire situation of freed people , Congress created the Bureau of Refugees , Freedmen , and Abandoned Lands in March 1865 , popularly known as the Freedmen ’s Bureau .",0

3565,"However , Congress mustered the necessary votes to override his veto .",0
3566,"Despite the Civil Rights Act , the black codes endured , forming the foundation of the racially discriminatory Jim Crow segregation policies that impoverished generations of African Americans .",0
3567,"Black voter registration in the late 1860s and the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment finally brought what Lincoln had characterized as “ a new birth of freedom . ” Union Leagues , fraternal groups founded in the North that promoted loyalty to the Union and the Republican Party during the Civil War , expanded into the South after the war and were transformed into political clubs that served both political and civic functions .",1
3568,"As centers of the black communities in the South , the leagues became vehicles for the dissemination of information , acted as mediators between members of the black community and the white establishment , and served other practical functions like helping to build schools and churches for the community they served .",0
3569,"Paramilitary white - supremacist terror organizations in the South helped bring about the collapse of Reconstruction , using violence as their primary weapon .",0
3570,"The “ Invisible Empire of the South , ” or Ku Klux Klan , stands as the most notorious .",0

3572,Congress also passed a series of three laws designed to stamp out the Klan .,0
3573,"Passed in 1870 and 1871 , the Enforcement Acts or “ Force Acts ” were designed to outlaw intimidation at the polls and to give the federal government the power to prosecute crimes against freed people in federal rather than state courts .",1

3576,"This phrase , which implies divine encouragement for territorial expansion , was coined by magazine editor John O’Sullivan in 1845 , when he wrote in the United States Magazine and Democratic Review that “ it was our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our multiplying millions . ” Although the context of O’Sullivan ’s original article was to encourage expansion into the newly acquired Texas territory , the spirit it invoked would subsequently be used to encourage westward settlement throughout the rest of the nineteenth century .",1
3577,"The first houses built by western settlers were typically made of mud and sod with thatch roofs , as there was little timber for building .",0
3578,"Rain , when it arrived , presented constant problems for these sod houses , with mud falling into food , and vermin , most notably lice , scampering across bedding ( [ link ] ) .",0

3590,"He next began to grow his company through vertical integration , wherein a company handles all aspects of a product ’s lifecycle , from the creation of raw materials through the production process to the delivery of the final product .",1
3591,"In Rockefeller ’s case , this model required investment and acquisition of companies involved in everything from barrel - making to pipelines , tanker cars to railroads .",0

3595,Urbanization occurred rapidly in the second half of the nineteenth century in the United States for a number of reasons .,0
3596,"The new technologies of the time led to a massive leap in industrialization , requiring large numbers of workers .",0
3597,"The primary form of relief for working - class urban Americans , and particularly immigrants , came in the form of machine politics .",0

3609,Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism .,1
3610,The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism .,1
3611,roteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early detection of cancer ; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process .,1
3612,"An individual protein is called a biomarker , whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature .",0
3613,"For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer , it must be secreted in body fluids , such as sweat , blood , or urine , such that large - scale screenings can be performed in a non - invasive fashion .",0
3614,arwin called this mechanism natural selection .,0
3615,"Natural selection , also known as “ survival of the fittest , ” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits ; this leads to evolutionary change .",1
3616,"ometimes , evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other .",0
3617,"When two species evolve in diverse directions from a common point , it is called divergent evolution .",1
3618,"Such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies ; however , they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators ( [ link]).Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor .",0
3619,"ome structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all , and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor .",1
3620,These unused structures without function are called vestigial structures .,0
3621,"Other examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds , leaves on some cacti , and hind leg bones in whales .",0
3622,"or example , even though bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) and African fish eagles ( Haliaeetus vocifer ) are both birds and eagles , each belongs to a separate species group ( [ link ] ) .",0
3623,"If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch , that offspring , called a hybrid ( a cross between two species ) , would probably be infertile — unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity .",1
3624,"Different species may have different genes that are active in development ; therefore , it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions .",0
3625,"llopatric speciation ( allo- = """" other """" ; -patric = """" homeland """" ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution .",1
3626,"Sympatric speciation ( sym- = """" same """" ; -patric = """" homeland """" ) involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location .",1
3627,eproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed .,1
3628,"In some cases , a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called autopolyploidy ( [ link ] ) .",1
3629,"The prefix “ auto- ” means “ self , ” so the term means multiple chromosomes from one ’s own species .",1
3630,ecall that a zygote is a fertilized egg : the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces sexually .,1
3631,"Therefore , a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction .",1
3632,A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile .,0
3633,"n some cases , populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species .",1
3634,This situation is called habitat isolation .,0
3635,"Reproduction with the parent species ceases , and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent .",0
3636,ybrid individuals in many cases can not form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages .,1
3637,This is called hybrid inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable .,0
3638,"In another postzygotic situation , reproduction leads to the birth and growth of a hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own ; this is called hybrid sterility .",1
3639,"eritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences , or genetic variance , among individuals in a population .",1
3640,"The greater the hereditability of a population ’s phenotypic variation , the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation .",0
3641,"hile it is likely to happen at some point , it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population , and as a result , the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool .",0
3642,"However , if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other , this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring , a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression .",1
3643,"enetic drift can also be magnified by natural events , such as a natural disaster that kills — at random — a large portion of the population .",0
3644,"Known as the bottleneck effect , it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out ( [ link ] ) .",1
3645,"In one fell swoop , the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population , which may be very different from the pre - disaster population .",0
3646,raits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection .,0
3647,"One common form of mate choice , called assortative mating , is an individual ’s preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves .",1
3648,"atural selection only acts on the population ’s heritable traits : selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population , while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency — a process known as adaptive evolution .",1
3649,"Natural selection does not act on individual alleles , however , but on entire organisms .",0
3650,"f natural selection favors an average phenotype , selecting against extreme variation , the population will undergo stabilizing selection ( [ link ] ) .",1
3651,"In a population of mice that live in the woods , for example , natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators .",0
3652,"nother type of selection , called frequency - dependent selection , favors phenotypes that are either common ( positive frequency - dependent selection ) or rare ( negative frequency - dependent selection ) .",1
3653,An interesting example of this type of selection is seen in a unique group of lizards of the Pacific Northwest .,0
3654,he good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease .,1
3655,"Females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority , which they will then pass on to their offspring .",0
3656,cientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms .,0
3657,A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms .,1
3658,Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one can not go back to confirm the proposed relationships .,0
3659,"he point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one .",1
3660,A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .,1
3661,"When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .",1
3662,"any disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time ; these disciplines together contribute to building , updating , and maintaining the “ tree of life . ” Information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics .",0
3663,"Data may be collected from fossils , from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism , and by DNA analysis .",0
3664,ithin each domain is a second category called a kingdom .,1
3665,"After kingdoms , the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are : phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species ( [ link ] ) .",0
3666,his usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions .,0
3667,"When similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship , it is called an analogy or homoplasy .",1
3668,"For example , insects use wings to fly like bats and birds , but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different .",0
3669,"o aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately , scientists often use a concept called maximum parsimony , which means that events occurred in the simplest , most obvious way .",1
3670,"For example , if a group of people entered a forest preserve to go hiking , based on the principle of maximum parsimony , one could predict that most of the people would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones .",0
3671,"he mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .",1
3672,"Most interestingly , the eukaryote - first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity ( [ link]c ) .",1
3673,All of these hypotheses are testable .,0
3674,"irions , single virus particles , are very small , about 20–250 nanometers in diameter .",0

3683,Group II viruses have single - stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) as their genome .,1
3684,They convert their single - stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur .,0
3685,roup IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity .,1
3686,Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA .,1
3687,"Intermediates of dsRNA , called replicative intermediates , are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA .",1
3688,"dditionally , full - length positive RNA strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative - stranded genome .",0
3689,"Group VI viruses have diploid ( two copies ) ssRNA genomes that must be converted , using the enzyme reverse transcriptase , to dsDNA ; the dsDNA is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome . Then , mRNA can be produced by transcription of the viral DNA that was integrated into the host genome .",1
3690,"he viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell , which may cause cell damage .",1
3691,"These changes , called cytopathic ( causing cell damage ) effects , can change cell functions or even destroy the cell .",0
3692,"Some infected cells , such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus , die through lysis ( bursting ) or apoptosis ( programmed cell death or “ cell suicide ” ) , releasing all progeny virions at once .",1
3693,"hen infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .",1
3694,"If the virions are released by bursting the cell , the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle ( [ link ] ) .",0
3695,"An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4 , which infects Escherichia coli found in the human intestinal tract .",0
3696,"n example is the animal herpesviruses , including herpes simplex viruses , the cause of oral and genital herpes in humans .",0
3697,"In a process called latency , these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions , only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates .",1
3698,"Even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency , the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages .",0
3699,xamples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza .,0
3700,"Other viruses cause long - term chronic infections , such as the virus causing hepatitis C , whereas others , like herpes simplex virus , only cause intermittent symptoms .",0
3701,"Still other viruses , such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7 , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola , often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection .",1
3702,"lant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors , through contact with an infected plant ’s sap , by living organisms such as insects and nematodes , and through pollen .",1
3703,"When plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission . Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) .",1
3704,"One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .",1
3705,"he danger of using live vaccines , which are usually more effective than killed vaccines , is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease - causing form by back mutations .",0
3706,Live vaccines are usually made by attenuating ( weakening ) the “ wild - type ” ( disease - causing ) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host .,1
3707,"Adaptations to these new cells or temperatures induce mutations in the genomes of the virus , allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause disease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host .",0
3708,he use of bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill them .,0
3709,"Although phage therapy is in use in the Republic of Georgia to treat antibiotic - resistant bacteria , its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries .",0
3710,"However , the safety of the treatment was confirmed in the United States when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen Listeria .",0
3711,"As more and more antibiotic - resistant strains of bacteria evolve , the use of bacteriophages might be a potential solution to the problem , and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide .",0

3844, heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation .,1
3845,Scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the “ fit ” of the population to its environment .,0
3846,"ver time , evolution led to changes in the shapes and sizes of these bones in different species , but they have maintained the same overall layout .",1
3847,Scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures .,0
3848," species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile , viable offspring .",1
3849,"According to this definition , one species is distinguished from another when , in nature , it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring .",0
3850,iologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories .,0
3851,"Allopatric speciation ( allo- = """" other """" ; -patric = """" homeland """" ) involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution .",1
3852,"Sympatric speciation ( sym- = """" same """" ; -patric = """" homeland """" ) involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location .",1
3853,"ver time , the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species .",1
3854,"This is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin ; thus , causing the species to radiate into several new ones .",0
3855,Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms .,0
3856,"iven enough time , the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction : if individuals of the two populations were to be brought together , mating would be less likely , but if mating occurred , offspring would be non - viable or infertile .",0
3857,"Many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation , the ability to interbreed , of the two populations .",1
3858,"any organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year , often just annually .",0
3859,"Differences in breeding schedules , called temporal isolation , can act as a form of reproductive isolation .",1
3860,"For example , two species of frogs inhabit the same area , but one reproduces from January to March , whereas the other reproduces from March to May ( [ link]).These two related frog species exhibit temporal reproductive isolation .",0
3861,ther prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells ( eggs and sperm ) prevent fertilization from taking place ; this is called a gametic barrier .,1
3862,"Similarly , in some cases closely related organisms try to mate , but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together .",0
3863,"n sum , the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes , such as natural selection , can affect a population ’s genetic makeup , and , in turn , how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species .",1
3864,"The theory also connects this change of a population over time , called microevolution , with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters , called macroevolution .",1
3865,"ome alleles will quickly become fixed in this way , meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele , while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool .",0
3866,The gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population .,1
3867,opulations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are called polymorphic .,1
3868,"The distribution of phenotypes among individuals , known as the population variation , is influenced by a number of factors , including the population ’s genetic structure and the environment ( [ link ] ) .",1
3869,Understanding the sources of a phenotypic variation in a population is important for determining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures .,0
3870,"hen scientists are involved in the breeding of a species , such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves , they try to increase a population ’s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can .",0
3871,"This also helps reduce the risks associated with inbreeding , the mating of closely related individuals , which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease .",1
3872,"For example , a disease that is caused by a rare , recessive allele might exist in a population , but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele .",0
3873,"nother way a population ’s allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift ( [ link ] ) , which is simply the effect of chance .",0
3874,"By chance , some individuals will have more offspring than others — not due to an advantage conferred by some genetically - encoded trait , but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time ( when the receptive female walked by ) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time ( when a fox was hunting ) .",1
3875,"f individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers , the result can be a changing population .",0
3876,There are many reasons nonrandom mating occurs .,0
3877,"One reason is simple mate choice ; for example , female peahens may prefer peacocks with bigger , brighter tails .",0
3878,uch geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant .,0
3879,"One type of geographic variation , called a cline , can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient .",1
3880,"Species of warm - blooded animals , for example , tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth ’s poles , allowing them to better conserve heat .",0
3881,"owever , it is not the absolute fitness of an individual that counts , but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population .",1
3882,"This concept , called relative fitness , allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation , and thus , how the population might evolve .",0
3883,"ometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection , while the intermediate phenotypes are , on average , less fit .",1
3884,"Known as diversifying selection ( [ link ] ) , this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms .",0
3885,"Large , dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force , while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male ’s territory .",0
3886,"he speculation is that large tails carry risk , and only the best males survive that risk : the bigger the tail , the more fit the male .",0
3887,This idea is known as the handicap principle .,0
3888,"n scientific terms , the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms is called its phylogeny .",1
3889,"A phylogeny describes the relationships of an organism , such as from which organisms it is thought to have evolved , to which species it is most closely related , and so forth .",0
3890,"n a rooted tree , the branching indicates evolutionary relationships ( [ link ] ) .",0
3891,"The point where a split occurs , called a branch point , represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one .",1
3892,A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .,1
3893,"hen two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .",1
3894,A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships .,1
3895,"It is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an ancestor , it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other .",0
3896,"or example , after the common beginning of all life , scientists divide organisms into three large categories called a domain : Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya .",1
3897,Within each domain is a second category called a kingdom .,1
3898,"After kingdoms , the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are : phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species ( [ link ] ) .",0
3899,"herefore , the scientific name of the dog is Canis lupus .",0
3900,The name at each level is also called a taxon .,1
3901,"In other words , dogs are in order Carnivora .",0
3902,ow do scientists construct phylogenetic trees ?,0
3903,"After the homologous and analogous traits are sorted , scientists often organize the homologous traits using a system called cladistics .",0

3906,"Only some of the organisms in [ link ] have this trait , and to those that do , it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree . The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative .",1
3907,The same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used .,0
3908,"ore recently , a fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered .",0
3909,"Small , virus - like particles called gene transfer agents ( GTAs ) transfer random genomic segments from one species of prokaryote to another .",1

3911,"he nucleus - first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ( [ link]a ) , followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria .",1
3912,"The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .",1
3913,"Most interestingly , the eukaryote - first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity ( [ link]c ) .",1
3914,"thers have proposed abandoning any tree - like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure , the so - called “ ring of life ” ( [ link ] ) ; a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes .",1

3922,Their mRNA is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular DNA .,0
3923,"he strands separate , and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mRNA using the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus .",0
3924,Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a positive polarity .,0
3925,Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA .,0
3926,"ultiple , full - length RNA strands of negative polarity ( complimentary to the positive - stranded genomic RNA ) are formed from these intermediates , which may then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polarity , including both full - length genomic RNA and shorter viral mRNAs .",0
3927,"Group V viruses contain ssRNA genomes with a negative polarity , meaning that their sequence is complementary to the mRNA .",0
3928,"As with Group IV viruses , dsRNA intermediates are used to make copies of the genome and produce mRNA .",0

3930,Cells that a virus may use to replicate are called permissive .,1

3932,"he symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus , which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body , and from cell damage caused by the virus .",0
3933,"Many animal viruses , such as HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) , leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding , where virions leave the cell individually .",1

4022,here are a number of types of mycorrhizae .,0
4023,Ectomycorrhizae ( “ outside ” mycorrhiza ) depend on fungi enveloping the roots in a sheath ( called a mantle ) and a Hartig net of hyphae that extends into the roots between cells ( [ link ] ) .,1
4024,"The fungal partner can belong to the Ascomycota , Basidiomycota or Zygomycota .",0

4026,"Lichens produce soredia , clusters of algal cells surrounded by mycelia .",0
4027,Soredia are dispersed by wind and water and form new lichens .,0
4028,"he term “ sporangia ” literally means “ spore in a vessel , ” as it is a reproductive sac that contains spores [ link ] .",1
4029,"Inside the multicellular sporangia , the diploid sporocytes , or mother cells , produce haploid spores by meiosis , where the 2n chromosome number is reduced to 1n ( note that many plant sporophytes are polyploid : for example , durum wheat is tetraploid , bread wheat is hexaploid , and some ferns are 1000-ploid ) .",1
4030,The spores are later released by the sporangia and disperse in the environment .,0
4031,"n contrast , heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores .",1
4032,"The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte .",1
4033,Heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants .,0
4034,"ametangia ( singular , gametangium ) are structures observed on multicellular haploid gametophytes .",1
4035,"In the gametangia , precursor cells give rise to gametes by mitosis .",0
4036,"aleobotanists distinguish between extinct species , as fossils , and extant species , which are still living .",1
4037,"The extinct vascular plants , classified as zosterophylls and trimerophytes , most probably lacked true leaves and roots and formed low vegetation mats similar in size to modern - day mosses , although some trimetophytes could reach one meter in height .",1
4038,iverworts ( Hepaticophyta ) are viewed as the plants most closely related to the ancestor that moved to land .,0
4039,Liverworts have colonized every terrestrial habitat on Earth and diversified to more than 7000 existing species ( [ link ] ) .,0
4040,"ore than 10,000 species of mosses have been catalogued .",0
4041,"Their habitats vary from the tundra , where they are the main vegetation , to the understory of tropical forests .",0

4044,"Xylem is the tissue responsible for the storage and long - distance transport of water and nutrients , as well as the transfer of water - soluble growth factors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs .",1
4045,"The tissue consists of conducting cells , known as tracheids , and supportive filler tissue , called parenchyma .",1
4046,he existence of two types of morphology suggests that leaves evolved independently in several groups of plants .,0
4047,"The first type of leaf is the microphyll , or “ little leaf , ” which can be dated to 350 million years ago in the late Silurian .",0
4048,A microphyll is small and has a simple vascular system .,1
4049,"n addition to photosynthesis , leaves play another role in the life of the plants .",0
4050,"Pine cones , mature fronds of ferns , and flowers are all sporophylls — leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia .",1

4065,"By far , the most well - known dissociative disorder is dissociative identity disorder ( formerly called multiple personality disorder ) .",0
4066,"People with dissociative identity disorder exhibit two or more separate personalities or identities , each well - defined and distinct from one another .",1
4067,Delusions are beliefs that are contrary to reality and are firmly held even in the face of contradictory evidence .,1
4068,"Many of us hold beliefs that some would consider odd , but a delusion is easily identified because it is clearly absurd .",0
4069,"Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements : becoming unusually active , exhibiting silly child - like behaviors ( giggling and self - absorbed smiling ) , engaging in repeated and purposeless movements , or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures .",1
4070,"In some cases , the person will exhibit catatonic behaviors , which show decreased reactivity to the environment , such as posturing , in which the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time , or catatonic stupor , a complete lack of movement and verbal behavior .",1
4071,"Brain imaging studies reveal that people with schizophrenia have enlarged ventricles , the cavities within the brain that contain cerebral spinal fluid ( Green , 2001 ) .",0
4072,"This finding is important because larger than normal ventricles suggests that various brain regions are reduced in size , thus implying that schizophrenia is associated with a loss of brain tissue .",0
4073,"Extremely stressful or traumatic events , such as combat , natural disasters , and terrorist attacks , place the people who experience them at an increased risk for developing psychological disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .",0
4074,"Throughout much of the 20th century , this disorder was called shell shock and combat neurosis because its symptoms were observed in soldiers who had engaged in wartime combat .",0
4075,"The DSM-5 recognizes 10 personality disorders , organized into 3 different clusters .",0
4076,"Cluster A disorders include paranoid personality disorder , schizoid personality disorder , and schizotypal personality disorder .",1
4077,People with these disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric .,0
4078,"The “ borderline ” in borderline personality disorder was originally coined in the late 1930s in an effort to describe patients who appeared anxious , but were prone to brief psychotic experiences — that is , patients who were thought to be literally on the borderline between anxiety and psychosis ( Freeman , Stone , Martin , & Reinecke , 2005 ) .",0
4079,"Today , borderline personality disorder has a completely different meaning .",0
4080,"Borderline personality disorder is characterized chiefly by instability in interpersonal relationships , self - image , and mood , as well as marked impulsivity ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
4081,The DSM-5 lists two general categories of mood disorders .,0
4082,Depressive disorders are a group of disorders in which depression is the main feature .,1
4083,"Depression is a vague term that , in everyday language , refers to an intense and persistent sadness .",1
4084,"According to the DSM-5 , the defining symptoms of major depressive disorder include “ depressed mood most of the day , nearly every day ” ( feeling sad , empty , hopeless , or appearing tearful to others ) , and loss of interest and pleasure in usual activities ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
4085,"In addition to feeling overwhelmingly sad most of each day , people with depression will no longer show interest or enjoyment in activities that previously were gratifying , such as hobbies , sports , sex , social events , time spent with family , and so on .",0
4086,"Another subtype , peripartum onset ( commonly referred to as postpartum depression ) , applies to women who experience major depression during pregnancy or in the four weeks following the birth of their child ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
4087,These women often feel very anxious and may even have panic attacks .,0
4088,"To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder , a person must have experienced a manic episode at least once in his life ; although major depressive episodes are common in bipolar disorder , they are not required for a diagnosis ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
4089,"According to the DSM-5 , a manic episode is characterized as a “ distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated , expansive , or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy lasting at least one week , ” that lasts most of the time each day ( APA , 2013 , p. 124 ) .",1
4090,"During a manic episode , some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative , sometimes spontaneously starting conversations with strangers ; others become excessively irritable and complain or make hostile comments .",0
4091,"Overwhelmed by hopelessness , devastated by incapacitating feelings of worthlessness , and burdened with the inability to adequately cope with such feelings , they may consider suicide to be a reasonable way out .",0
4092,"Suicide , defined by the CDC as “ death caused by self - directed injurious behavior with any intent to die as the result of the behavior ” ( CDC , 2013a ) , in a sense represents an outcome of several things going wrong all at the same time Crosby , Ortega , & Melanson , 2011 ) .",1
4093,"Not only must the person be biologically or psychologically vulnerable , but he must also have the means to perform the suicidal act , and he must lack the necessary protective factors ( e.g. , social support from friends and family , religion , coping skills , and problem - solving skills ) that provide comfort and enable one to cope during times of crisis or great psychological pain ( Berman , 2009 ) .",0
4094,"An individual with body dysmorphic disorder is preoccupied with a perceived flaw in her physical appearance that is either nonexistent or barely noticeable to other people ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
4095,"These perceived physical defects cause the person to think she is unattractive , ugly , hideous , or deformed .",0
4096,"The symptoms of OCD have been theorized to be learned responses , acquired and sustained as the result of a combination of two forms of learning : classical conditioning and operant conditioning ( Mowrer , 1960 ; Steinmetz , Tracy , & Green , 2001 ) .",0
4097,"Specifically , the acquisition of OCD may occur first as the result of classical conditioning , whereby a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus that provokes anxiety or distress .",0
4098,"Social anxiety disorder ( formerly called social phobia ) is characterized by extreme and persistent fear or anxiety and avoidance of social situations in which the person could potentially be evaluated negatively by others ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
4099,"As with specific phobias , social anxiety disorder is common in the United States ; a little over 12 % of all Americans experience social anxiety disorder during their lifetime ( Kessler et al . , 2005 ) .",0
4100,Groups of people would suddenly begin to dance with wild abandon .,0
4101,This compulsion to dance — referred to as dancing mania — sometimes gripped thousands of people at a time ( [ link ] ) .,0
4102,"Historical accounts indicate that those afflicted would sometimes dance with bruised and bloody feet for days or weeks , screaming of terrible visions and begging priests and monks to save their souls ( Waller , 2009b ) .",0
4103,"A psychological disorder is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts , feelings , and behaviors .",1
4104,"Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders , including their symptoms , etiology ( i.e. , their causes ) , and treatment .",1
4105,"Violating cultural expectations is not , in and of itself , a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a psychological disorder .",0
4106,"Since behavior varies from one culture to another , what may be expected and considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures .",0
4107,"For example , returning a stranger ’s smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate friendly gestures .",0
4108,How do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not a person ’s inner states and behaviors truly represent a psychological disorder ?,0
4109,"Arriving at a proper diagnosis — that is , appropriately identifying and labeling a set of defined symptoms — is absolutely crucial .",1
4110,"This process enables professionals to use a common language with others in the field and aids in communication about the disorder with the patient , colleagues and the public .",0
4111,"A second classification system , the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) , is also widely recognized .",0
4112,"Published by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the ICD was developed in Europe shortly after World War II and , like the DSM , has been revised several times .",0
4113,"In this dimension , people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers , cold , nonconformists , impulsive , antisocial , and hostile , whereas people who are high on superego control tend to have high impulse control — they are more altruistic , empathetic , cooperative , and conventional ( Eysenck , Eysenck & Barrett , 1985).While Cattell ’s 16 factors may be too broad , the Eysenck ’s two - factor system has been criticized for being too narrow .",0
4114,"Another personality theory , called the Five Factor Model , effectively hits a middle ground , with its five factors referred to as the Big Five personality traits .",0
4115,"It is the most popular theory in personality psychology today and the most accurate approximation of the basic trait dimensions ( Funder , 2001 ) .",0
4116,"One explanation for the regional differences is selective migration ( Rentfrow et al . , 2013 ) .",0
4117,Selective migration is the concept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with their personalities and needs .,1
4118,The Rorschach Inkblot Test was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach ( pronounced “ ROAR - shock ” ) .,0
4119,It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by a psychologist .,0
4120,"To address this need , Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective test designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans ( Hoy - Watkins & Jenkins - Moore , 2008 ) .",0
4121,"The updated version of the instrument is the Contemporized - Themes Concerning Blacks Test ( C - TCB ) ( Williams , 1972 ) .",0
4122,"A certain amount of unemployment is a direct result of the relative inflexibility of the labor market , considered structural unemployment , which describes when there is a societal level of disjuncture between people seeking jobs and the available jobs .",1
4123,"This mismatch can be geographic ( they are hiring in California , but most unemployed live in Alabama ) , technological ( skilled workers are replaced by machines , as in the auto industry ) , or can result from any sudden change in the types of jobs people are seeking versus the types of companies that are hiring .",0
4124,"In 1893 , Émile Durkheim described what he called “ mechanical ” and “ organic ” solidarity that correlates to a society ’s economy .",0
4125,"Mechanical solidarity exists in simpler societies where social cohesion comes from sharing similar work , education , and religion .",1
4126,Organic solidarity arises out of the mutual interdependence created by the specialization of work .,1
4127,"To solve this problem , people developed the idea of a means of exchange that could be used at any time : that is , money .",0
4128,Money refers to an object that a society agrees to assign a value to so it can be exchanged for payment .,1
4129,"In early economies , money was often objects like cowry shells , rice , barley , or even rum .",0
4130,Scholars do n’t always agree on a single definition of capitalism .,0
4131,"For our purposes , we will define capitalism as an economic system in which there is private ownership ( as opposed to state ownership ) and where there is an impetus to produce profit , and thereby wealth .",1
4132,This is the type of economy in place in the United States today .,0
4133,"By this he meant that if an owner did not work to produce or earn the property , then the owner was stealing it from those who did .",0
4134,"Proudhon believed economies could work using a principle called mutualism , under which individuals and cooperative groups would exchange products with one another on the basis of mutually satisfactory contracts ( Proudhon 1840).By far the most important influential thinker on socialism is Karl Marx .",1
4135,"Through his own writings and those with his collaborator , industrialist Friedrich Engels , Marx used a scientific analytical process to show that throughout history , the resolution of class struggles caused changes in economies .",0
4136,The functionalist would say to let market forces fluctuate in a cycle through these stages .,0
4137,"In reality , to control the risk of an economic depression ( a sustained recession across several economic sectors ) , the U.S. government will often adjust interest rates to encourage more lending — and consequently more spending .",1
4138,"In short , letting the natural cycle fluctuate is not a gamble most governments are willing to take .",0
4139,Factors that define stratification vary in different societies .,0
4140,"In most societies , stratification is an economic system , based on wealth , the net value of money and assets a person has , and income , a person ’s wages or investment dividends .",1
4141,"While people are regularly categorized based on how rich or poor they are , other important factors influence social standing .",0
4142,A class system is based on both social factors and individual achievement .,1
4143,"A class consists of a set of people who share similar status with regard to factors like wealth , income , education , and occupation .",1
4144,"Unlike caste systems , class systems are open .",0
4145,MeritocracyMeritocracy is an ideal system based on the belief that social stratification is the result of personal effort — or merit — that determines social standing .,1
4146,"High levels of effort will lead to a high social position , and vice versa .",0
4147,"In the last century , the United States has seen a steady rise in its standard of living , the level of wealth available to a certain socioeconomic class in order to acquire the material necessities and comforts to maintain its lifestyle .",1
4148,"The standard of living is based on factors such as income , employment , class , poverty rates , and housing affordability .",0
4149,"In the United States , people who earn a college degree , get a job promotion , or marry someone with a good income may move up socially .",0
4150,"In contrast , downward mobility indicates a lowering of one ’s social class .",1
4151,"Some people move downward because of business setbacks , unemployment , or illness .",0
4152,"Patterns of intergenerational mobility can reflect long - term societal changes . Similarly , intragenerational mobility refers to changes in a person 's social mobility over the course of his or her lifetime .",1
4153,"For example , the wealth and prestige experienced by one person may be quite different from that of his or her siblings . Structural mobility happens when societal changes enable a whole group of people to move up or down the social class ladder .",1
4154,"Structural mobility is attributable to changes in society as a whole , not individual changes .",0
4155,"In 1945 , sociologists Kingsley Davis and Wilbert Moore published the Davis - Moore thesis , which argued that the greater the functional importance of a social role , the greater must be the reward .",0
4156,The theory posits that social stratification represents the inherently unequal value of different work .,1
4157,"In fact , a recent Oxfam ( 2014 ) report that suggested the richest eighty - five people in the world are worth more than the poorest 3.5 billion combined .",0
4158,The GINI coefficient measures income inequality between countries using a 100-point scale on which 1 represents complete equality and 100 represents the highest possible inequality .,1
4159,"In 2007 , the global GINI coefficient that measured the wealth gap between the core nations in the northern part of the world and the mostly peripheral nations in the southern part of the world was 75.5 percent ( Korseniewicz and Moran 2009 ) .",0
4160,"When this nomenclature was developed , capitalistic democracies such as the United States and Japan were considered part of the first world .",0
4161,"The poorest , most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America , and Asia .",1
4162,"The second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as China or Cuba .",1
4163,Those that were in a state of subordination faced significant obstacles to mobilization .,0
4164,"Core nations are dominant capitalist countries , highly industrialized , technological , and urbanized .",1
4165,"For example , Wallerstein contends that the United States is an economic powerhouse that can support or deny support to important economic legislation with far - reaching implications , thus exerting control over every aspect of the global economy and exploiting both semi - peripheral and peripheral nations .",0
4166,The OECD ( Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development ) countries make up a group of thirty - four nations whose governments work together to promote economic growth and sustainability .,0
4167,"According to the World Bank ( 2014b ) , in 2013 , the average gross national income ( GNI ) per capita , or the mean income of the people in a nation , found by dividing total GNI by the total population , of a high - income nation belonging to the OECD was $ 43,903 per capita and the total population was over one billion ( 1.045 billion ) ; on average , 81 percent of the population in these nations was urban .",0
4168,"Some of these countries include the United States , Germany , Canada , and the United Kingdom ( World Bank 2014b).High - income countries face two major issues : capital flight and deindustrialization .",0
4169,Perhaps the most pressing issue for middle - income nations is the problem of debt accumulation .,0
4170,"As the name suggests , debt accumulation is the buildup of external debt , wherein countries borrow money from other nations to fund their expansion or growth goals .",1
4171,"As the uncertainties of the global economy make repaying these debts , or even paying the interest on them , more challenging , nations can find themselves in trouble .",0
4172,Subjective poverty describes poverty that is composed of many dimensions ; it is subjectively present when your actual income does not meet your expectations and perceptions .,1
4173,"With the concept of subjective poverty , the poor themselves have a greater say in recognizing when it is present .",0
4174,"Child slavery , which may include child prostitution , is a form of chattel slavery .",0
4175,"In debt bondage , or bonded labor , the poor pledge themselves as servants in exchange for the cost of basic necessities like transportation , room , and board .",1
4176,"In this scenario , people are paid less than they are charged for room and board .",0
4177,"According to Zimmerman , Martin attacked him , and in the ensuing scuffle Martin was shot and killed ( CNN Library 2014).A public outcry followed Martin ’s death .",0
4178,"There were allegations of racial profiling — the use by law enforcement of race alone to determine whether to stop and detain someone — a national discussion about “ Stand Your Ground Laws , ” and a failed lawsuit in which Zimmerman accused NBC of airing an edited version of the 911 call that made him appear racist .",1
4179,"Zimmerman was not arrested until April 11 , when he was charged with second - degree murder by special prosecutor Angela Corey .",0
4180,"Sociologist Louis Wirth ( 1945 ) defined a minority group as “ any group of people who , because of their physical or cultural characteristics , are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment , and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination . ” The term minority connotes discrimination , and in its sociological use , the term subordinate group can be used interchangeably with the term minority , while the term dominant group is often substituted for the group that ’s in the majority .",1
4181,"These definitions correlate to the concept that the dominant group is that which holds the most power in a given society , while subordinate groups are those who lack power compared to the dominant group .",1
4182,"Prejudice refers to the beliefs , thoughts , feelings , and attitudes someone holds about a group .",1
4183,"A prejudice is not based on experience ; instead , it is a prejudgment , originating outside actual experience .",0
4184,"For example , the disproportionate number of black men arrested , charged , and convicted of crimes may reflect racial profiling , a form of institutional racism .",0
4185,"Colorism is another kind of prejudice , in which someone believes one type of skin tone is superior or inferior to another within a racial group .",1
4186,"Studies suggest that darker skinned African Americans experience more discrimination than lighter skinned African Americans ( Herring , Keith , and Horton 2004 ; Klonoff and Landrine 2000 ) .",0
4187,"Institutional discrimination can also include the promotion of a group 's status , such in the case of white privilege , which is the benefits people receive simply by being part of the dominant group . While most white people are willing to admit that nonwhite people live with a set of disadvantages due to the color of their skin , very few are willing to acknowledge the benefits they receive . Racial Tensions in the United States The death of Michael Brown in Ferguson , MO on August 9 , 2014 illustrates racial tensions in the United States as well as the overlap between prejudice , discrimination , and institutional racism .",1
4188,"On that day , Brown , a young unarmed black man , was killed by a white police officer named Darren Wilson .",0
4189,"For example , Vivien Thomas ( 1910–1985 ) , the black surgical technician who helped develop the groundbreaking surgical technique that saves the lives of “ blue babies ” was classified as a janitor for many years , and paid as such , despite the fact that he was conducting complicated surgical experiments .",0
4190,"The years since the Civil War have showed a pattern of attempted disenfranchisement , with gerrymandering and voter suppression efforts aimed at predominantly minority neighborhoods . Feminist sociologist Patricia Hill Collins ( 1990 ) developed intersection theory , which suggests we can not separate the effects of race , class , gender , sexual orientation , and other attributes .",1
4191,"When we examine race and how it can bring us both advantages and disadvantages , it is important to acknowledge that the way we experience race is shaped , for example , by our gender and class .",0
4192,"Expulsion refers to a subordinate group being forced , by a dominant group , to leave a certain area or country .",1
4193,"As seen in the examples of the Trail of Tears and the Holocaust , expulsion can be a factor in genocide .",0
4194,Assimilation describes the process by which a minority individual or group gives up its own identity by taking on the characteristics of the dominant culture .,1
4195,"In the United States , which has a history of welcoming and absorbing immigrants from different lands , assimilation has been a function of immigration .",0
4196,"However , sociologists and most other social scientists view them as conceptually distinct .",0
4197,"Sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females , including both primary sex characteristics ( the reproductive system ) and secondary characteristics such as height and muscularity . Gender refers to behaviors , personal traits , and social positions that society attributes to being female or male . A person ’s sex , as determined by his or her biology , does not always correspond with his or her gender .",1
4198,"Heterosexuals and homosexuals may also be referred to informally as “ straight ” and “ gay , ” respectively .",0
4199,"The United States is a heteronormative society , meaning it assumes sexual orientation is biologically determined and unambiguous .",1
4200,"Consider that homosexuals are often asked , “ When did you know you were gay ? ” but heterosexuals are rarely asked , “ When did you know that you were straight ? ” ( Ryle 2011 ) .",0
4201,"In this socialization process , children are introduced to certain roles that are typically linked to their biological sex .",0
4202,The term gender role refers to society ’s concept of how men and women are expected to look and how they should behave .,1
4203,"These roles are based on norms , or standards , created by society .",0
4204,"However , it is estimated that two to five percent of the U.S. population is transgender ( Transgender Law and Policy Institute 2007 ) .",0
4205,Transgender individuals who attempt to alter their bodies through medical interventions such as surgery and hormonal therapy — so that their physical being is better aligned with gender identity — are called transsexuals .,1
4206,They may also be known as male - to - female ( MTF ) or female - to - male ( FTM ) .,0
4207,"Furthermore , the word gay ( as it refers to a homosexual ) , carried a somewhat negative and unfavorable meaning fifty years ago , but it has since gained more neutral and even positive connotations .",1
4208,"When people perform tasks or possess characteristics based on the gender role assigned to them , they are said to be doing gender .",1
4209,This notion is based on the work of West and Zimmerman ( 1987 ) .,0
4210,"Sexual Attitudes and PracticesIn the area of sexuality , sociologists focus their attention on sexual attitudes and practices , not on physiology or anatomy .",0
4211,Sexuality is viewed as a person ’s capacity for sexual feelings .,1
4212,Studying sexual attitudes and practices is a particularly interesting field of sociology because sexual behavior is a cultural universal .,0
4213,The Gerontology Research Group ( 2014 ) estimates there are between 300 and 450 people worldwide who are at least 110 years of age .,0
4214,"Centenarians are people living to be 100 years old , and they are approximately 1,000 times more common than supercentenarians .",1
4215,"In 2010 , there were about 80,000 centenarians in the United States alone .",0
4216,"This median age has been increasing , which indicates the population as a whole is growing older .",0
4217,A cohort is a group of people who share a statistical or demographic trait .,1
4218,People belonging to the same age cohort were born in the same time frame .,0
4219,"From 1950 to approximately 2010 , the global population of individuals age sixty - five and older increased by a range of 5–7 percent ( Lee 2009 ) .",0
4220,"This percentage is expected to increase and will have a huge impact on the dependency ratio : the number of nonproductive citizens ( young , disabled , or elderly ) to productive working citizens ( Bartram and Roe 2005 ) .",1
4221,"One country that will soon face a serious aging crisis is China , which is on the cusp of an “ aging boom ” — a period when its elderly population will dramatically increase .",1
4222,"Dr. Ignatz Nascher and the Birth of GeriatricsIn the early 1900s , a New York physician named Dr. Ignatz Nascher coined the term geriatrics , a medical specialty that focuses on the elderly .",1
4223,He created the word by combining two Greek words : geron ( old man ) and iatrikos ( medical treatment ) .,0
4224,"It broke new ground and opened the doors for sociologists , social workers , health practitioners , and therapists to study death and help those who were facing death .",0
4225,Kübler - Ross ’s work is generally considered a major contribution to thanatology : the systematic study of death and dying .,1
4226,"The loss of independence is one potential part of the process , as are diminished physical ability and age discrimination .",0
4227,"The term senescence refers to the aging process , including biological , emotional , intellectual , social , and spiritual changes .",1
4228,This section discusses some of the challenges we encounter during this process .,0
4229,This makes the care - providing situation more complex .,0
4230,Elder abuse occurs when a caretaker intentionally deprives an older person of care or harms the person in his or her charge .,1
4231,"Caregivers may be family members , relatives , friends , health professionals , or employees of senior housing or nursing care .",0
4232,"According to continuity theory , the elderly make specific choices to maintain consistency in internal ( personality structure , beliefs ) and external structures ( relationships ) , remaining active and involved throughout their elder years .",1
4233,This is an attempt to maintain social equilibrium and stability by making future decisions on the basis of already developed social roles ( Atchley 1971 ; Atchley 1989 ) .,0
4234,"Finally , exchange theory ( Dowd 1975 ) , a rational choice approach , suggests we experience an increased dependence as we age and must increasingly submit to the will of others because we have fewer ways of compelling others to submit to us .",1
4235,"Indeed , inasmuch as relationships are based on mutual exchanges , as the elderly become less able to exchange resources , they will see their social circles diminish .",0
4236,"In many cultures , newly married couples move in with , or near to , family members .",0
4237,In a patrilocal residence system it is customary for the wife to live with ( or near ) her husband ’s blood relatives ( or family or orientation ) .,1
4238,Patrilocal systems can be traced back thousands of years .,0
4239,"It is often characterized as violence between household or family members , specifically spouses .",1
4240,"To include unmarried , cohabitating , and same - sex couples , family sociologists have created the term intimate partner violence ( IPV ) .",0
4241,Women are the primary victims of intimate partner violence .,0
4242,"These universals , and the differences in the way societies and individuals experience religion , provide rich material for sociological study . In studying religion , sociologists distinguish between what they term the experience , beliefs , and rituals of a religion .",0
4243,Religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that we are connected to “ the divine . ” This type of communion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate .,1
4244,"Religious beliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true , such as that Jesus Christ was the son of God , or that reincarnation exists .",1
4245,"For example , Christianity began as a cult , transformed into a sect , and today exists as an ecclesia .",0
4246,"Cults , like sects , are new religious groups .",0
4247,In the United States today this term often carries pejorative connotations .,0
4248,"For instance , the Christian notion of the Holy Trinity ( God , Jesus , Holy Spirit ) defies the definition of monotheism , which is a religion based on belief in a single deity , to some scholars .",1
4249,"Similarly , many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism ’s godhead as polytheistic , which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities , , while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity .",1
4250,"Some Japanese practice Shinto , which follows animism , which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings .",1
4251,"Liberation theology began as a movement within the Roman Catholic Church in the 1950s and 1960s in Latin America , and it combines Christian principles with political activism .",1
4252,"It uses the church to promote social change via the political arena , and it is most often seen in attempts to reduce or eliminate social injustice , discrimination , and poverty .",0
4253,Formal education describes the learning of academic facts and concepts through a formal curriculum .,1
4254,"Arising from the tutelage of ancient Greek thinkers , centuries of scholars have examined topics through formalized methods of learning .",0
4255,Another global concern in education is universal access .,0
4256,This term refers to people ’s equal ability to participate in an education system .,1
4257,"Such a situation leads to social class reproduction , extensively studied by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu .",0
4258,"He researched how cultural capital , or cultural knowledge that serves ( metaphorically ) as currency that helps us navigate a culture , alters the experiences and opportunities available to French students from different social classes .",1
4259,Members of the upper and middle classes have more cultural capital than do families of lower - class status .,0
4260,"In 2001 , the Bush administration passed the No Child Left Behind Act , which requires states to test students in designated grades .",1
4261,The results of those tests determine eligibility to receive federal funding .,0
4262,"According to Weber , the power of traditional authority is accepted because that has traditionally been the case ; its legitimacy exists because it has been accepted for a long time .",0
4263,"Britain ’s Queen Elizabeth , for instance , occupies a position that she inherited based on the traditional rules of succession for the monarchy .",0
4264,"According to Weber , power made legitimate by laws , written rules , and regulations is termed rational - legal authority .",1
4265,"In this type of authority , power is vested in a particular rationale , system , or ideology and not necessarily in the person who implements the specifics of that doctrine .",0
4266,"As mentioned above , the monarchies of most modern nations are ceremonial remnants of tradition , and individuals who hold titles in such sovereignties are often aristocratic figureheads . A few nations today , however , are run by governments wherein a monarch has absolute or unmitigated power .",1
4267,Such nations are called absolute monarchies .,0
4268,"Although governments and regimes are constantly changing across the global landscape , it is generally safe to say that most modern absolute monarchies are concentrated in the Middle East and Africa .",0
4269,Power in a dictatorship is held by a single person ( or a very small group ) that wields complete and absolute authority over a government and population .,0
4270,"Like some absolute monarchies , dictatorships may be corrupt and seek to limit or even eradicate the liberties of the general population .",1
4271,"Thus , the United States is a constitution - based federal republic in which citizens elect representatives to make policy decisions on their behalf .",1
4272,"The term representative democracy , which is virtually synonymous with republic , can also be used to describe a government in which citizens elect representatives to promote policies that favor their interests .",1
4273,"In the United States , representatives are elected at local and state levels , and the votes of the Electoral College determine who will hold the office of president .",0
4274,"Marx believed that conflict between groups struggling to either attain wealth and power or keep the wealth and power they had was inevitable in a capitalist society , and conflict was the only way for the underprivileged to eventually gain some measure of equality . C .",0
4275,"Wright Mills ( 1956 ) elaborated on some of Marx ’s concepts , coining the phrase power elite to describe what he saw as the small group of powerful people who control much of a society .",1
4276,"This must be contrasted with the absolute poverty that is frequently found in underdeveloped countries and defined as the inability , or near - inability , to afford basic necessities such as food ( Byrns 2011 ) .",1
4277,We can not even rely on unemployment statistics to provide a clear picture of total unemployment in the United States .,0
4278,"First , unemployment statistics do not take into account underemployment , a state in which a person accepts a lower paying , lower status job than their education and experience qualifies them to perform .",1
4279,"Second , unemployment statistics only count those :",0
4280,"We see the emergence of global assembly lines , where products are assembled over the course of several international transactions .",1
4281,"For instance , Apple designs its next - generation Mac prototype in the United States , components are made in various peripheral nations , they are then shipped to another peripheral nation such as Malaysia for assembly , and tech support is outsourced to India . Globalization has also led to the development of global commodity chains , where internationally integrated economic links connect workers and corporations for the purpose of manufacture and marketing ( Plahe 2005 ) .",1
4282,What if the U.S. economy thrived solely on basic bartering instead of its bustling agricultural and technological goods ?,0
4283,"Would you still see a busy building like the one shown in [ link]?In sociology , economy refers to the social institution through which a society ’s resources are exchanged and managed .",1
4284,"The earliest economies were based on trade , which is often a simple exchange in which people traded one item for another .",1
4285,"At first , most goods and services were traded as gifts or through bartering between small social groups ( Mauss 1922 ) .",0
4286,Exchanging one form of goods or services for another was known as bartering .,1
4287,This system only works when one person happens to have something the other person needs at the same time .,0
4288,The Industrial Revolution also changed agricultural practices .,0
4289,"Until that time , many people practiced subsistence farming in which they produced only enough to feed themselves and pay their taxes .",1
4290,"New technology introduced gasoline - powered farm tools such as tractors , seed drills , threshers , and combine harvesters .",0
4291,"Because of challenges in their economies , several of these communist countries have moved from central planning to letting market forces help determine many production and pricing decisions .",0
4292,"Market socialism describes a subtype of socialism that adopts certain traits of capitalism , like allowing limited private ownership or consulting market demands .",1
4293,This could involve situations like profits generated by a company going directly to the employees of the company or being used as public funds ( Gregory and Stuart 2003 ) .,0
4294,"Markets produce goods as they are supposed to , but eventually the market is saturated and the supply of goods exceeds the demands .",0
4295,"Typically the market goes through phases of surplus , or excess , inflation , where the money in your pocket today buys less than it did yesterday , and recession , which occurs when there are two or more consecutive quarters of economic decline .",1
4296,The functionalist would say to let market forces fluctuate in a cycle through these stages .,0
4297,Sociologists use the term social stratification to describe the system of social standing .,0
4298,"Social stratification refers to a society ’s categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth , income , race , education , and power .",1
4299,"This was generally a closed system , with people born into positions of nobility .",0
4300,"Wealth was passed from generation to generation through primogeniture , a law stating that all property would be inherited by the firstborn son .",1
4301,"If the family had no son , the land went to the next closest male relation .",0
4302,Individuals can experience upward or downward social mobility for a variety of reasons .,0
4303,Upward mobility refers to an increase — or upward shift — in social class .,1
4304,"In the United States , people applaud the rags - to - riches achievements of celebrities like Jennifer Lopez or Michael Jordan .",0
4305,"Global stratification compares the wealth , economic stability , status , and power of countries across the world .",1
4306,"Global stratification highlights worldwide patterns of social inequality . In the early years of civilization , hunter - gatherer and agrarian societies lived off the earth and rarely interacted with other societies .",0
4307,"Just as the United States ' wealth is increasingly concentrated among its richest citizens while the middle class slowly disappears , global inequality is concentrating resources in certain nations and is significantly affecting the opportunities of individuals in poorer and less powerful countries .",1
4308,"In fact , a recent Oxfam ( 2014 ) report that suggested the richest eighty - five people in the world are worth more than the poorest 3.5 billion combined .",0
4309,"Familiar and still used by many , it classifies countries into first world , second world , and third world nations based on their respective economic development and standards of living .",0
4310,"When this nomenclature was developed , capitalistic democracies such as the United States and Japan were considered part of the first world .",1
4311,"The poorest , most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America , and Asia .",1
4312,"The second world was the in - between category : nations not as limited in development as the third world , but not as well off as the first world , having moderate economies and standard of living , such as China or Cuba .",1
4313,"Later , sociologist Manual Castells ( 1998 ) added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice all over the globe ( indigenous minority populations , prisoners , and the homeless , for example ) .",1
4314,"Also during the Cold War , global inequality was described in terms of economic development .",0
4315,"We can be sure the workers in a Cuban cigar factory , for example , which are owned or leased by global core nation companies , are not enjoying the same privileges and rights as U.S. workers .",0
4316,"Semi - peripheral nations are in - between nations , not powerful enough to dictate policy but nevertheless acting as a major source for raw material and an expanding middle - class marketplace for core nations , while also exploiting peripheral nations .",1
4317,"Mexico is an example , providing abundant cheap agricultural labor to the U.S. , and supplying goods to the United States market at a rate dictated by the U.S. without the constitutional protections offered to United States workers .",0
4318,"Capital flight refers to the movement ( flight ) of capital from one nation to another , as when General Motors automotive company closed U.S. factories in Michigan and opened factories in Mexico .",1
4319,"Deindustrialization , a related issue , occurs as a consequence of capital flight , as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations .",1
4320,"As expected , global companies move their industrial processes to the places where they can get the most production with the least cost , including the building of infrastructure , training of workers , shipping of goods , and , of course , paying employee wages .",0
4321,People often disparage “ keeping up with the Joneses ” — the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors’ standard of living to not feel deprived .,0
4322,"But it is true that you might feel ” poor ” if you are living without a car to drive to and from work , without any money for a safety net should a family member fall ill , and without any “ extras ” beyond just making ends meet . Contrary to relative poverty , people who live in absolute poverty lack even the basic necessities , which typically include adequate food , clean water , safe housing , and access to healthcare .",1
4323,Absolute poverty is defined by the World Bank ( 2014a ) as when someone lives on less than $ 1.25 a day .,1
4324,Dependency TheoryDependency theory was created in part as a response to the Western - centric mindset of modernization theory .,0
4325,"It states that global inequality is primarily caused by core nations ( or high - income nations ) exploiting semi - peripheral and peripheral nations ( or middle - income and low - income nations ) , which creates a cycle of dependence ( Hendricks 2010 ) .",1
4326,"Ethnicity is a term that describes shared culture — the practices , values , and beliefs of a group . This culture might include shared language , religion , and traditions , among other commonalities .",1
4327,Let us explore the differences between these concepts .,0
4328,Stereotypes are oversimplified generalizations about groups of people .,1
4329,"Stereotypes can be based on race , ethnicity , age , gender , sexual orientation — almost any characteristic .",0
4330,The Ku Klux Klan is an example of a racist organization ; its members ' belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech .,1
4331,Institutional racism refers to the way in which racism is embedded in the fabric of society .,1
4332,"For example , the disproportionate number of black men arrested , charged , and convicted of crimes may reflect racial profiling , a form of institutional racism .",0
4333,"For example , when a newspaper identifies by race individuals accused of a crime , it may enhance stereotypes of a certain minority .",0
4334,"Another example of racist practices is racial steering , in which real estate agents direct prospective homeowners toward or away from certain neighborhoods based on their race .",1
4335,Racist attitudes and beliefs are often more insidious and harder to pin down than specific racist practices .,0
4336,"Ferguson ’s racial imbalance may explain in part why , even though in 2010 only about 63 percent of its population was black , in 2013 blacks were detained in 86 percent of stops , 92 percent of searches , and 93 percent of arrests ( Missouri Attorney General ’s Office 2014 ) .",0
4337,"In addition , de facto segregation in Ferguson ’s schools , a race - based wealth gap , urban sprawl , and a black unemployment rate three times that of the white unemployment rate worsened existing racial tensions in Ferguson while also reflecting nationwide racial inequalities ( Bouie 2014).Multiple IdentitiesGolfer Tiger Woods has Chinese , Thai , African American , Native American , and Dutch heritage .",0
4338,Individuals with multiple ethnic backgrounds are becoming more common .,0
4339,"Genocide , the deliberate annihilation of a targeted ( usually subordinate ) group , is the most toxic intergroup relationship .",1
4340,"Historically , we can see that genocide has included both the intent to exterminate a group and the function of exterminating of a group , intentional or not .",0
4341,Pluralism is represented by the ideal of the United States as a “ salad bowl ” : a great mixture of different cultures where each culture retains its own identity and yet adds to the flavor of the whole .,0
4342,"True pluralism is characterized by mutual respect on the part of all cultures , both dominant and subordinate , creating a multicultural environment of acceptance .",1
4343,"Asian Americans certainly have been subject to their share of racial prejudice , despite the seemingly positive stereotype as the model minority .",0
4344,"The model minority stereotype is applied to a minority group that is seen as reaching significant educational , professional , and socioeconomic levels without challenging the existing establishment .",1
4345,"Other advocacy agencies frequently use the acronyms LBGT and LBGTQ , which stands for “ Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender ” ( and “ Queer ” or “ Questioning ” when the Q is added).Sociologically , it is clear that gay and lesbian couples are negatively affected in states where they are denied the legal right to marriage .",1
4346,"In 1996 , The Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) was passed , explicitly limiting the definition of “ marriage ” to a union between one man and one woman .",1
4347,It also allowed individual states to choose whether or not they recognized same - sex marriages performed in other states .,0
4348,Gender identity is a person ’s deeply held internal perception of his or her gender .,1
4349,Individuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex are called transgender .,1
4350,"Transgender is not the same as homosexual , and many homosexual males view both their sex and gender as male .",0
4351,Gender stereotypes form the basis of sexism .,0
4352,Sexism refers to prejudiced beliefs that value one sex over another .,1
4353,It varies in its level of severity .,0
4354,The social construction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex - linked behavior shape the way people see and experience sexuality .,1
4355,"This is in marked contrast to theories of sex , gender , and sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism , or the belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their biology .",0
4356,Madame Jeanne Calment of France was the world 's oldest living person until she died at 122 years old ; there are currently six women in the world whose ages are well documented as 115 years or older ( Diebel 2014).Supercentenarians are people living to 110 years or more .,1
4357,"In August 2014 , there were seventy - five verified supercentenarians worldwide — seventy - three women and two men .",0
4358,Social gerontology refers to a specialized field of gerontology that examines the social ( and sociological ) aspects of aging .,1
4359,"Researchers focus on developing a broad understanding of the experiences of people at specific ages , such as mental and physical wellbeing , plus age - specific concerns such as the process of dying .",0
4360,"Baby BoomersOf particular interest to gerontologists today is the population of baby boomers , the cohort born between 1946 and 1964 and now reaching their 60s .",1
4361,"Coming of age in the 1960s and early 1970s , the baby boom generation was the first group of children and teenagers with their own spending power and therefore their own marketing power ( Macunovich 2000 ) .",0
4362,It is helpful to understand aging in the context of these phases .,0
4363,"A life course is the period from birth to death , including a sequence of predictable life events such as physical maturation .",1
4364,"Each phase comes with different responsibilities and expectations , which of course vary by individual and culture .",0
4365,"For many teenagers and young adults , losing a grandparent or another older relative can be the first loss of a loved one they experience .",0
4366,"It may be their first encounter with grief , a psychological , emotional , and social response to the feelings of loss that accompanies death or a similar event .",1
4367,The changing concept of hospice is an indicator of our society ’s changing view of death .,0
4368,Hospice is a type of healthcare that treats terminally ill people when “ cure - oriented treatments ” are no longer an option ( Hospice Foundation of America 2012b ) .,1
4369,"In early societies , the elderly were respected and revered .",0
4370,"Many preindustrial societies observed gerontocracy , a type of social structure wherein the power is held by a society ’s oldest members .",1
4371,"In some countries today , the elderly still have influence and power and their vast knowledge is respected .",0
4372,"The social withdrawal that Cummings and Henry recognized ( 1961 ) , and its notion that elderly people need to find replacement roles for those they ’ve lost , is addressed anew in activity theory .",0
4373,"According to this theory , activity levels and social involvement are key to this process , and key to happiness ( Havinghurst 1961 ; Neugarten 1964 ; Havinghurst , Neugarten , and Tobin 1968 ) .",1
4374,"Another theory in the conflict perspective is age stratification theory ( Riley , Johnson , and Foner 1972 ) .",0
4375,"Though it may seem obvious now , with our awareness of ageism , age stratification theorists were the first to suggest that members of society might be stratified by age , just as they are stratified by race , class , and gender .",0
4376,Another theory within the symbolic interaction perspective is selective optimization with compensation theory .,0
4377,"Baltes and Baltes ( 1990 ) based their theory on the idea that successful personal development throughout the life course and subsequent mastery of the challenges associated with everyday life are based on the components of selection , optimization , and compensation .",1
4378,"Sociologists , on the other hand , tend to define family more in terms of the manner in which members relate to one another than on a strict configuration of status roles .",0
4379,"Here , we ’ll define family as a socially recognized group ( usually joined by blood , marriage , cohabitation , or adoption ) that forms an emotional connection and serves as an economic unit of society .",1
4380,Sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them .,0
4381,"Marriage PatternsWith single parenting and cohabitation ( when a couple shares a residence but not a marriage ) becoming more acceptable in recent years , people may be less motivated to get married .",1
4382,"In a recent survey , 39 percent of respondents answered “ yes ” when asked whether marriage is becoming obsolete ( Pew Research Center 2010 ) .",0
4383,Instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of polygyny .,0
4384,Polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at the same time .,1
4385,"The reverse , when a woman is married to more than one man at the same time , is called polyandry .",1
4386,Both paternal and maternal ancestors are considered part of one ’s family .,1
4387,This pattern of tracing kinship is called bilateral descent .,0
4388,"Note that kinship , or one ’s traceable ancestry , can be based on blood or marriage or adoption .",1
4389,"There are three types of unilateral descent : patrilineal , which follows the father ’s line only ; matrilineal , which follows the mother ’s side only ; and ambilineal , which follows either the father ’s only or the mother ’s side only , depending on the situation .",1
4390,"In partrilineal societies , such as those in rural China and India , only males carry on the family surname .",0
4391,"Today , however , these models have been criticized for their linear and conventional assumptions as well as for their failure to capture the diversity of family forms .",0
4392,"While reviewing some of these once - popular theories , it is important to identify their strengths and weaknesses . The set of predictable steps and patterns families experience over time is referred to as the family life cycle .",1
4393,One of the first designs of the family life cycle was developed by Paul Glick in 1955 .,0
4394,"Of these children , 54 percent live with grandparents , 21 percent live with other relatives , and 24 percent live with nonrelatives .",0
4395,"This family structure is referred to as the extended family , and may include aunts , uncles , and cousins living in the same home .",0
4396,Foster parents account for about a quarter of nonrelatives .,0
4397,"Some people associate religion with places of worship ( a synagogue or church ) , others with a practice ( confession or meditation ) , and still others with a concept that guides their daily lives ( like dharma or sin ) .",0
4398,"All these people can agree that religion is a system of beliefs , values , and practices concerning what a person holds sacred or considers to be spiritually significant . Does religion bring fear , wonder , relief , explanation of the unknown or control over freedom and choice ?",1
4399,How do our religious perspectives affect our behavior ?,0
4400,Another illustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different religions .,0
4401,"Religious rituals are behaviors or practices that are either required or expected of the members of a particular group , such as bar mitzvah or confession of sins ( Barkan and Greenwood 2003).The History of Religion as a Sociological ConceptIn the wake of nineteenth century European industrialization and secularization , three social theorists attempted to examine the relationship between religion and society : Émile Durkheim , Max Weber , and Karl Marx .",1
4402,They are among the founding thinkers of modern sociology .,0
4403,Some sects do not grow into denominations .,1
4404,Sociologists call these established sects .,0
4405,"Established sects , such as the Amish or Jehovah ’s Witnesses fall halfway between sect and denomination on the ecclesia – cult continuum because they have a mixture of sect - like and denomination - like characteristics .",0
4406,Note that some religions may be practiced — or understood — in various categories .,0
4407,"For instance , the Christian notion of the Holy Trinity ( God , Jesus , Holy Spirit ) defies the definition of monotheism , which is a religion based on belief in a single deity , to some scholars .",0
4408,"Similarly , many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism ’s godhead as polytheistic , which is a religion based on belief in multiple deities , , while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity .",0
4409,"Some Japanese practice Shinto , which follows animism , which is a religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings , like animals , plants , and objects of the natural world , while people who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings .",1
4410,"It is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers , such as atheists , who do not believe in a divine being or entity , and agnostics , who hold that ultimate reality ( such as God ) is unknowable .",1
4411,"While typically not an organized group , atheists and agnostics represent a significant portion of the population .",0
4412,"Education is a social institution through which a society ’s children are taught basic academic knowledge , learning skills , and cultural norms .",1
4413,"Every nation in the world is equipped with some form of education system , though those systems vary greatly .",0
4414,"Cultural transmission refers to the way people come to learn the values , beliefs , and social norms of their culture .",1
4415,Both informal and formal education include cultural transmission .,0
4416,"Another role of schools , according to functionalist theory , is that of sorting , or classifying students based on academic merit or potential .",0
4417,The most capable students are identified early in schools through testing and classroom achievements .,0
4418,This hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally .,0
4419,"Conflict theorists point to tracking , a formalized sorting system that places students on “ tracks ” ( advanced versus low achievers ) that perpetuate inequalities .",1
4420,"While educators may believe that students do better in tracked classes because they are with students of similar ability and may have access to more individual attention from teachers , conflict theorists feel that tracking leads to self - fulfilling prophecies in which students live up ( or down ) to teacher and societal expectations ( Education Week 2004 ) .",0
4421,The findings in the Coleman Report were so powerful that they brought about two major changes to education in the United States .,0
4422,"The federal Head Start program , which is still active and successful today , was developed to give low - income students an opportunity to make up the preschool deficit discussed in Coleman ’s findings .",0
4423,The program provides academic - centered preschool to students of low socioeconomic status .,1
4424,"Government leaders might have this kind of influence as well , but they also have the advantage of wielding power associated with their position in the government .",0
4425,"As this example indicates , there is more than one type of authority in a community . Authority refers to accepted power — that is , power that people agree to follow .",1
4426,People listen to authority figures because they feel that these individuals are worthy of respect .,0
4427,Followers accept the power of charismatic authority because they are drawn to the leader ’s personal qualities .,0
4428,"The appeal of a charismatic leader can be extraordinary , and can inspire followers to make unusual sacrifices or to persevere in the midst of great hardship and persecution .",0
4429,The power held by these positions varies from one country to another .,0
4430,"Strictly speaking , a monarchy is a government in which a single person ( a monarch ) rules until he or she dies or abdicates the throne .",1
4431,"Usually , a monarch claims the rights to the title by way of hereditary succession or as a result of some sort of divine appointment or calling .",0
4432,"The power in an oligarchy is held by a small , elite group .",1
4433,"Unlike in a monarchy , members of an oligarchy do not necessarily achieve their statuses based on ties to noble ancestry .",0
4434,"A democracy is a form of government that strives to provide all citizens with an equal voice , or vote , in determining state policy , regardless of their level of socioeconomic status .",1
4435,Another important fundamental of the democratic state is the establishment and governance of a just and comprehensive constitution that delineates the roles and responsibilities of leaders and citizens alike .,0
4436,"Shortly before the Voting Rights Act was passed , the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court case Reynolds v. Sims changed the nature of elections .",0
4437,"This landmark decision reaffirmed the notion of “ one person , one vote , ” a concept holding that all people ’s votes should be counted equally .",1
4438,"Now , let ’s look at what happens with protectionism .",0
4439,"U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that , if only they could be protected from sugar imported from Brazil , the United States would have higher domestic sugar production , more jobs in the sugar industry , and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price .",0
4440,"While the United States economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment rates — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , from spring 2008 to late 2009 , the unemployment rate rose from 4.4 % to 10 % ; it has since fallen back to 5.5 % in spring 2015—the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time .",0
4441,"The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 138 million in 2012.Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but , for two reasons , it costs jobs in other unprotected industries .",0
4442,"First , if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry , they inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries , and so jobs are lost in those other industries .",0
4443,"One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high - skilled , high - wage workers in the United States , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers .",0
4444,"After all , high - skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers , machinery , and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage .",0
4445,"Meanwhile , low - skilled U.S. workers must now compete against extremely low - wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing .",0
4446,Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production .,1
4447,Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production .,1
4448,"If free trade meant the destruction of life itself , then even economists would convert to protectionism !",0
4449,"While globalization — and economic activity of all kinds — can pose environmental dangers , it seems quite possible that , with the appropriate safeguards in place , the environmental impacts of trade can be minimized .",0
4450,The race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this .,0
4451,"Profit - seeking multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak standards , thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits .",0
4452,The United Nations was unable to agree to this .,0
4453,"Instead , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , was established in 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade .",1
4454,"In 1995 , the GATT was transformed into the WTO .",0
4455,"For the United States , perhaps the best - known regional trading agreement is the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .",0
4456,"The United States also participates in some less - prominent regional trading agreements , like the Caribbean Basin Initiative , which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries , and a free trade agreement with Israel .",1
4457,What is a function ?,0
4458,A function describes a relationship .,1
4459,Sometimes the relationship is a definition .,0
4460,"The concept of slope is very useful in economics , because it measures the relationship between two variables .",1
4461,"A positive slope means that two variables are positively related ; that is , when x increases , so does y , or when x decreases , y decreases also .",1
4462,"Graphically , a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right , the line rises .",0
4463,"The graphs we have discussed so far are called line graphs , because they show a relationship between two variables : one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis .",1
4464,A pie graph ( sometimes called a pie chart ) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts .,1
4465,A circle represents a group as a whole .,0
4466,"This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences , called indifference curves , which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility .",1
4467,By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility — an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic — the indifference curve framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model . What Is an Indifference Curve ?,0
4468,"From this starting point , her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low , while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high — so on the margin , it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book .",0
4469,"In short , the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution — that is , the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant — also changes , as a result of diminishing marginal utility of both goods .",1
4470,Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations : a substitution effect and an income effect .,0
4471,"The substitution effect is that when a good becomes more expensive , people seek out substitutes .",1
4472,"If oranges become more expensive , fruit - lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples , grapefruit , or raisins .",0
4473,"The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen , so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive , but if she had remained at the same level of utility .",0
4474,The slope of the budget constraint in a labor - leisure diagram is determined by the wage rate .,0
4475,"Thus , the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set , reflecting the labor - leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate , but tangent to the original indifference curve , showing the same level of utility or “ buying power . ” The shift from original choice A to point C , which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line , shows that because of the higher wage , Petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income .",0
4476,"The expenditure - output model , sometimes also called the Keynesian cross diagram , determines the equilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced .",1
4477,The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in [ link ] show real GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending .,0
4478,"When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium , it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real GDP — because by definition , GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy .",1
4479,"Thus , the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal — which will only occur along the 45-degree line .",0
4480,"The marginal propensity to consume ( MPC ) , is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures .",1
4481,The marginal propensity to save ( MPS ) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save .,1
4482,It must always hold true that :,0
4483,"Imports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward - sloping line , with the downward slope determined by the marginal propensity to import ( MPI ) , out of national income .",0
4484,"In [ link ] ( b ) , the marginal propensity to import is 0.1 .",0
4485,"The aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function ( after taxes ) , the investment function , the government spending function , the export function , and the import function .",1
4486,"The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment , government , and export expenditures — which do not vary with national income .",0
4487,"Conversely , [ link ] ( b ) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule ( AE0 ) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP .",0
4488,The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E0 and potential GDP is called an inflationary gap .,1
4489,The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting .,0
4490,The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency .,0
4491,One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another .,1
4492,"Conversely , if a situation is inefficient , it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others . Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning : The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved .",1
4493,"Those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $ 45 , but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $ 80 , clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product .",0
4494,The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller ’s actual cost is called producer surplus .,1
4495,"In [ link ] , producer surplus is the area labeled G — that is , the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium . The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus , also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus .",1
4496,"In a very real sense , it is like money thrown away that benefits no one .",0
4497,"In [ link ] ( a ) , the deadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight loss exists , it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher , in this case because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to make . A second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers .",0
4498,"In many cases , a business that focuses on one or a few products ( sometimes called its “ core competency ” ) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products .",1
4499,"Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines .",0
4500,"For example , if a factory produces only 100 cars per year , each car will be quite expensive to make on average .",0
4501,"For the United States , this is the Federal Reserve .",0
4502,"Fiscal policy , which involves government spending and taxes , is determined by a nation ’s legislative body .",1
4503,"For the United States , this is the Congress and the executive branch , which originates the federal budget .",0
4504,Sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory .,0
4505,"Strictly speaking , a theory is a more abstract representation , while a model is more applied or empirical representation .",0
4506,There are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy .,0
4507,"The first is the traditional economy , which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of Asia , Africa , and South America .",0
4508,"Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done ( i.e. , tradition ) .",1
4509,"The New York Stock Exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together .",0
4510,"In a market economy , decision - making is decentralized .",0
4511,Market economies are based on private enterprise : the means of production ( resources and businesses ) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals .,1
4512,"The Rise of GlobalizationRecent decades have seen a trend toward globalization , which is the expanding cultural , political , and economic connections between people around the world .",1
4513,"One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods , services , and assets across national borders — in other words , international trade and financial capital flows .",0
4514,Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically .,1
4515,The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) .,1
4516,"Thus , the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country ’s total economic production is sold in other countries .",0
4517,"In many cases , it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price .",0
4518,"If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $ 300 , then $ 300 measures the amount of “ other consumption ” that he has given up .",0
4519,The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern .,1
4520,"Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility , which means that as a person receives more of a good , the additional ( or marginal ) utility from each additional unit of the good declines .",0
4521,"In other words , the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth . The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all - or - nothing choices .",0
4522,The opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to give up .,0
4523,"Just as with Alphonso ’s budget constraint , the opportunity cost is shown by the slope of the production possibilities frontier .",0
4524,"By now you might be saying , “ Hey , this PPF is sounding like the budget constraint . ” If so , read the following Clear It Up feature .",0
4525,"In everyday usage , efficiency refers to lack of waste .",0
4526,"An inefficient machine operates at high cost , while an efficient machine operates at lower cost , because it is not wasting energy or materials .",1
4527,"An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs , while an efficient organization meets schedules , is focused , and performs within budget .",1
4528,"For government , this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm .",0
4529,"At the individual and firm level , the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity , quality , and price that people want .",0
4530,"But for both the government and the market economy in the short term , increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy .",0
4531,"Fortunately however , the assumption that individuals are purely self - interested is a simplification about human nature .",0
4532,"In fact , we need to look no further than to Adam Smith , the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this .",0
4533,"The opening sentence of his book , The Theory of Moral Sentiments , puts it very clearly : “ How selfish soever man may be supposed , there are evidently some principles in his nature , which interest him in the fortune of others , and render their happiness necessary to him , though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it . ” Clearly , individuals are both self - interested and altruistic .",0
4534,"The third theme is economic efficiency , or getting the most benefit from scarce resources .",1
4535,"All choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases , there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other .",0
4536,"To find answers to these questions , we need to understand the concept of elasticity .",0
4537,Elasticity is an economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable .,1
4538,Suppose you drop two items from a second - floor balcony .,0
4539,The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .,1
4540,"The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .",1
4541,"An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .",1
4542,Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .,0
4543,"Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] .",1
4544,Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all .,1
4545,"In both cases , the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in [ link ] .",0
4546,"Constant unitary elasticity , in either a supply or demand curve , occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one percent .",1
4547,[ link ] shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity .,0
4548,"Income Elasticity of DemandThe income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income . Income elasticity of demand=% change in quantity demanded% change in incomeIncome elasticity of demand=% change in quantity demanded% change in incomeFor most products , most of the time , the income elasticity of demand is positive : that is , a rise in income will cause an increase in the quantity demanded .",1
4549,This pattern is common enough that these goods are referred to as normal goods .,0
4550,"However , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers , because they are buying more steak instead , or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer .",0
4551,"Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital MarketsThe concept of elasticity applies to any market , not just markets for goods and services .",0
4552,"In the labor market , for example , the wage elasticity of labor supply — that is , the percentage change in hours worked divided by the percentage change in wages — will determine the shape of the labor supply curve .",0
4553,Specifically :,0
4554,"If the firm is successful , the outputs are more valuable than the inputs .",0
4555,"This activity of production goes beyond manufacturing ( i.e. , making things ) .",0
4556,"It includes any process or service that creates value , including transportation , distribution , wholesale and retail sales .",0
4557,Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs .,0
4558,"Implicit costs are more subtle , but just as important .",0
4559,They represent the opportunity cost of using resources already owned by the firm .,1
4560,The cost of producing a firm ’s output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses .,0
4561,A list of the costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer software or haircuts or fast - food meals .,0
4562,"Variable costs , on the other hand , are incurred in the act of producing — the more you produce , the greater the variable cost .",1
4563,"Labor is treated as a variable cost , since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more workers or more work hours .",0
4564,"But as output expands still further , the average cost begins to rise .",0
4565,"At the right side of the average cost curve , total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing returns kick in . Average variable cost obtained when variable cost is divided by quantity of output .",0
4566,"For example , the variable cost of producing 80 haircuts is $ 400 , so the average variable cost is $ 400/80 , or $ 5 per haircut .",0
4567,Average cost tells a firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market .,0
4568,"If we divide profit by the quantity of output produced we get average profit , also known as the firm ’s profit margin .",1
4569,Expanding the equation for profit gives :,0
4570,"While in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve ( corresponding to the level of fixed costs they have chosen ) , in the long run when all costs are variable , they can choose to operate on any average cost curve .",0
4571,"Thus , the long - run average cost ( LRAC ) curve is actually based on a group of short - run average cost ( SRAC ) curves , each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs .",0
4572,"More precisely , the long - run average cost curve will be the least expensive average cost curve for any level of output .",1
4573,"Diseconomies of scale can also be present across an entire firm , not just a large factory .",0
4574,"The leviathan effect can hit firms that become too large to run efficiently , across the entirety of the enterprise .",0
4575,"Firms that shrink their operations are often responding to finding itself in the diseconomies region , thus moving back to a lower average cost at a lower output level . Visit this website to read an article about the complexity of the belief that banks can be “ too - big - to - fail . ”",0
4576,What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price .,1
4577,The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded .,1
4578,A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service .,0
4579,"The quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons over some time period ( for example , per day or per year ) and over some geographic area ( like a state or a country ) .",0
4580,"A demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like [ link ] , with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis .",1
4581,( Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable ( x ) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable ( y ) goes on the vertical .,0
4582,Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .,1
4583,"A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied .",0
4584,"When the price of gasoline rises , for example , it encourages profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand exploration for oil reserves ; drill for more oil ; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline ; build new oil refineries ; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours .",0
4585,"Again , price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons .",0
4586,"A supply curve is a graphic illustration of the relationship between price , shown on the vertical axis , and quantity , shown on the horizontal axis .",1
4587,The supply schedule and the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information .,0
4588,"The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity .",1
4589,"At any other price , the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied , so the market is not in equilibrium at that price .",0
4590,The previous module explored how price affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied .,0
4591,The result was the demand curve and the supply curve .,0
4592,"For some — luxury cars , vacations in Europe , and fine jewelry — the effect of a rise in income can be especially pronounced .",0
4593,"A product whose demand rises when income rises , and vice versa , is called a normal good .",1
4594,A few exceptions to this pattern do exist .,0
4595,The demand for a product can also be affected by changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements .,0
4596,A substitute is a good or service that can be used in place of another good or service .,1
4597,"As electronic books , like this one , become more available , you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books .",0
4598,"If other factors relevant to supply do change , then the entire supply curve will shift .",0
4599,"Just as a shift in demand is represented by a change in the quantity demanded at every price , a shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price .",0
4600,"According to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press , more and more people , especially younger people , are getting their news from online and digital sources .",0
4601,"The majority of U.S. adults now own smartphones or tablets , and most of those Americans say they use them in part to get the news .",0
4602,Laws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls .,1
4603,Price controls come in two flavors .,0
4604,"Markets for labor have demand and supply curves , just like markets for goods .",0
4605,"The law of demand applies in labor markets this way : A higher salary or wage — that is , a higher price in the labor market — leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers , while a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded .",0
4606,"The law of supply functions in labor markets , too : A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied ; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied . Equilibrium in the Labor Market",0
4607,"The demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage rate , under the ceteris paribus assumption .",1
4608,A change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the quantity demanded of labor .,0
4609,Some was invested in private companies or loaned to government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass transit .,0
4610,"Some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses . In this section , we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply financial capital ( i.e. , savings ) with those who demand financial capital ( i.e. , borrowing ) .",0
4611,"Those who save money ( or make financial investments , which is the same thing ) , whether individuals or businesses , are on the supply side of the financial market .",0
4612,Participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods : now or in the future .,1
4613,Economists call this intertemporal decision making because it involves decisions across time .,0
4614,"Unlike a decision about what to buy from the grocery store , decisions about investment or saving are made across a period of time , sometimes a long period .",0
4615,A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to other markets .,0
4616,The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive .,0
4617,Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices .,1
4618,"If José had unlimited income or goods were free , then he could consume without limit .",0
4619,"But José , like all of us , faces a budget constraint .",0
4620,José has a total of $ 56 to spend .,0
4621,The fourth T - shirt is just to something to wear when all his other clothes are in the wash and yields only 18 additional utils .,0
4622,"This is an example of the law of diminishing marginal utility , which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added .",1
4623,The general rule can also be expressed as the ratio of the prices of the two goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities .,0
4624,"When the price of good 1 is divided by the price of good 2 , at the utility - maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good 1 divided by the marginal utility of good 2 .",1
4625,"This rule , known as the consumer equilibrium , can be written in algebraic form :",0
4626,"Conversely , when income falls , the most typical reaction is to purchase less of both goods .",0
4627,"As defined in the chapter on Demand and Supply and again in the chapter on Elasticity , goods and services are called normal goods when a rise in income leads to a rise in the quantity consumed of that good and a fall in income leads to a fall in quantity consumed . However , depending on Kimberly ’s preferences , a rise in income could cause consumption of one good to increase while consumption of the other good declines .",1
4628,"A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline , while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline .",0
4629,The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price .,1
4630,"The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) .",1
4631,"In this example , the higher price for baseball bats would cause Sergei to buy a fewer bats for both reasons .",0
4632,"The middle , close - to - vertical portion of the labor supply curve reflects the situation of a person who reacts to a higher wage by supplying about the same quantity of labor .",0
4633,"The very top portion of the labor supply curve is called a backward - bending supply curve for labor , which is the situation of high - wage people who can earn so much that they respond to a still - higher wage by working fewer hours .",1
4634,Read the following Clear It Up feature for more on the number of hours the average person works each year .,0
4635,Yelberton will compare the different choices along the budget constraint and choose the one that provides him with the highest utility .,0
4636,"For example , he will compare the utility he would receive from a choice like point A , with consumption of $ 1 million in the present , zero savings , and zero future consumption ; point B , with present consumption of $ 800,000 , savings of $ 200,000 , and future consumption of $ 1,148,000 ; point C , with present consumption of $ 600,000 , savings of $ 400,000 , and future consumption of $ 2,296,000 ; or even choice D , with present consumption of zero , savings of $ 1,000,000 , and future consumption of $ 5,740,000 .",0
4637,We tend to focus more on the loss than the gain .,1
4638,"This is known as loss aversion , where a $ 1 loss pains us 2.25 times more than a $ 1 gain helps us , according to the economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a famous 1979 article in the journal Econometrica .",0
4639,"This insight has implications for investing , as people tend to “ overplay ” the stock market by reacting more to losses than to gains .",0
4640,"Firms are said to be in perfect competition when the following conditions occur : ( 1 ) many firms produce identical products ; ( 2 ) many buyers are available to buy the product , and many sellers are available to sell the product ; ( 3 ) sellers and buyers have all relevant information to make rational decisions about the product being bought and sold ; and ( 4 ) firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions — in other words , there is free entry and exit into and out of the market .",1
4641,"Total revenue and total costs for the raspberry farm , broken down into fixed and variable costs , are shown in [ link ] and also appear in [ link ] .",0
4642,"The horizontal axis shows the quantity of frozen raspberries produced in packs ; the vertical axis shows both total revenue and total costs , measured in dollars .",0
4643,"New firms may start production , as well .",0
4644,When new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called entry . Losses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee .,1
4645,"If a business is making losses in the short run , it will either keep limping along or just shut down , depending on whether its revenues are covering its variable costs .",0
4646,"Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that , in the long run , pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a zero profit . To understand how short - run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run , imagine the following situation .",0
4647,"The market is in long - run equilibrium , where all firms earn zero economic profits producing the output level where P = MR = MC and P = AC .",0
4648,No firm has the incentive to enter or leave the market .,0
4649,"For a decreasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience lower costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a lower price than before .",1
4650,"In this case , the industry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs .",0
4651,"In this chapter , we explore the opposite extreme : monopoly . If perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market price , monopoly is a market with no competition at all , and firms have complete market power .",0
4652,"In the case of monopoly , one firm produces all of the output in a market .",1
4653,"Since a monopoly faces no significant competition , it can charge any price it wishes .",0
4654,"One is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition .",1
4655,"The other is legal monopoly , where laws prohibit ( or severely limit ) competition .",1
4656,"A trademark is an identifying symbol or name for a particular good , like Chiquita bananas , Chevrolet cars , or the Nike “ swoosh ” that appears on shoes and athletic gear .",1
4657,Roughly 1.9 million trademarks are registered with the U.S. government .,0
4658,"Taken together , this combination of patents , trademarks , copyrights , and trade secret law is called intellectual property , because it implies ownership over an idea , concept , or image , not a physical piece of property like a house or a car .",1
4659,"Countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property , although the time periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries .",0
4660,"Profits for the monopolist , like any firm , will be equal to total revenues minus total costs .",0
4661,"The pattern of costs for the monopoly can be analyzed within the same framework as the costs of a perfectly competitive firm — that is , by using total cost , fixed cost , variable cost , marginal cost , average cost , and average variable cost .",0
4662,"However , because a monopoly faces no competition , its situation and its decision process will differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm .",0
4663,"[ link ] repeats the marginal cost and marginal revenue data from [ link ] , and adds two more columns : Marginal profit is the profitability of each additional unit sold .",1
4664,It is defined as marginal revenue minus marginal cost .,0
4665,"What about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these extremes , firms that could be described as imperfectly competitive ?",0
4666,What determines their behavior ?,0
4667,"Monopolistic competition involves many firms competing against each other , but selling products that are distinctive in some way .",1
4668,Examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing ; restaurants or grocery stores that sell different kinds of food ; and even products like golf balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar but differ in public perception because of advertising and brand names .,0
4669,A monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition .,1
4670,"[ link ] offers a reminder that the demand curve as faced by a perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic or flat , because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at the prevailing market price .",0
4671,"In contrast , the demand curve , as faced by a monopolist , is the market demand curve , since a monopolist is the only firm in the market , and hence is downward sloping .",0
4672,"As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits , new competitors will continue to enter the market , reducing the original firm ’s demand and marginal revenue curves .",0
4673,"The long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point Y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve .",0
4674,The long - term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the price level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve .,0
4675,This outcome is why perfect competition displays productive efficiency : goods are being produced at the lowest possible average cost .,0
4676,"However , in monopolistic competition , the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that lies on the downward - sloping portion of the average cost curve , not at the very bottom of the AC curve .",0
4677,"Similarly , a natural monopoly will arise when the quantity demanded in a market is only large enough for a single firm to operate at the minimum of the long - run average cost curve .",0
4678,"In such a setting , the market has room for only one firm , because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to compete , and no larger firm could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market .",0
4679,"When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion .",1
4680,A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel .,1
4681,See the following Clear It Up feature for a more in - depth analysis of the difference between the two .,0
4682,"Because of the complexity of oligopoly , which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms , there is no single , generally - accepted theory of how oligopolies behave , in the same way that we have theories for all the other market structures .",1
4683,"Instead , economists use game theory , a branch of mathematics that analyzes situations in which players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide to do .",1
4684,"Game theory has found widespread applications in the social sciences , as well as in business , law , and military strategy .",0
4685,"The result of this prisoner ’s dilemma is often that even though A and B could make the highest combined profits by cooperating in producing a lower level of output and acting like a monopolist , the two firms may well end up in a situation where they each increase output and earn only $ 400 each in profits .",0
4686,The following Clear It Up feature discusses one cartel scandal in particular .,0
4687,"If one firm cuts its price to $ 300 , it will be able to sell only 11,000 seats .",0
4688,"However , if the airline seeks to raise prices , the other oligopolists will not raise their prices , and so the firm that raised prices will lose a considerable share of sales .",0
4689,A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm .,1
4690,"When one firm purchases another , it is called an acquisition .",1
4691,"An acquisition may not look just like a merger , since the newly purchased firm may continue to be operated under its former company name .",0
4692,"In an early demonstration of the law ’s power , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government ’s right to break up Standard Oil , which had controlled about 90 % of the country ’s oil refining , into 34 independent firms , including Exxon , Mobil , Amoco , and Chevron .",0
4693,"In 1914 , the Clayton Antitrust Act outlawed mergers and acquisitions ( where the outcome would be to “ substantially lessen competition ” in an industry ) , price discrimination ( where different customers are charged different prices for the same product ) , and tied sales ( where purchase of one product commits the buyer to purchase some other product ) .",1
4694,"Also in 1914 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair .",0
4695,"An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms .",1
4696,"For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy , refer to Monopoly . Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market .",0
4697,"The four - firm concentration ratio is calculated by adding the market shares of the four largest firms : in this case , 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40 .",0
4698,"However , in the total market for all computer software and services , including everything from games to scientific programs , the Microsoft share was only about 14 % in 2014 .",0
4699,"A narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher , while a broadly defined market will tend to make it appear smaller . There are two especially important shifts affecting how markets are defined in recent decades : one centers on technology and the other centers on globalization .",1
4700,"In addition , these two shifts are interconnected .",0
4701,"Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition .",1
4702,"Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price .",1
4703,A minimum price contract is illegal because it would restrict competition among dealers .,0
4704,"Even if a customer was interested in a portable TV , the tying to a particular model prevents the customer from having the option of selecting one from the numerous types available in the market .",0
4705,"A related , but not identical , concept is called bundling , where two or more products are sold as one .",1
4706,Bundling typically offers an advantage for the consumer by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for a better price .,0
4707,"A natural monopoly poses a difficult challenge for competition policy , because the structure of costs and demand seems to make competition unlikely or costly .",0
4708,A natural monopoly arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand .,1
4709,This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs .,0
4710,"They calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies , added in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn , and set the price for consumers accordingly .",1
4711,This method was known as cost - plus regulation .,0
4712,"One difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call regulatory capture , in which the firms supposedly being regulated end up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow .",1
4713,"When the airline industry was being regulated , for example , it suggested appointees to the regulatory board , sent lobbyists to argue with the board , provided most of the information on which the board made decisions , and offered well - paid jobs to at least some of the people leaving the board .",0
4714,"Private markets , such as the cell phone industry , offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and determine what goods are produced , how they are produced , and who gets them .",0
4715,The principle that voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking .,0
4716,"Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .",1
4717,"If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .",0
4718,"If you love country music , then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a positive externality .",0
4719,"In a market with no anti - pollution restrictions , firms can dispose of certain wastes absolutely free .",0
4720,"Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator , but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution .",0
4721,"If the firm is required to pay $ 100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator , production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ 100 .",0
4722,"Other laws required the installation of certain equipment — for example , on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks — to reduce pollution .",0
4723,"These types of laws , which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution - control technologies must be used , fall under the category of command - and - control regulation .",0
4724,"In effect , command - and - control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti - pollution equipment ; firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account . Command - and - control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the U.S. environment .",1
4725,A pollution charge is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits .,1
4726,A pollution charge gives a profit - maximizing firm an incentive to figure out ways to reduce its emissions — as long as the marginal cost of reducing the emissions is less than the tax .,0
4727,Another application of marketable permits occurred when the Clean Air Act was amended in 1990 .,0
4728,"The revised law sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of the 1980 levels out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid rain , which harms forests as well as buildings .",0
4729,The definition of ecotourism is a little vague .,1
4730,"Does it mean sleeping on the ground , eating roots , and getting close to wild animals ?",0
4731,No nation by itself can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by enough to solve the problem of global warming — not without the cooperation of other nations .,0
4732,"Another issue is the challenge of preserving biodiversity , which includes the full spectrum of animal and plant genetic material .",1
4733,"Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders , no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world .",0
4734,The tradeoff between economic output and the environment can be analyzed with a production possibility frontier ( PPF ) such as the one shown in [ link ] .,1
4735,"At one extreme , at a choice like P , a country would be selecting a high level of economic output but very little environmental protection .",0
4736,"Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier .",1
4737,"However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it .",1
4738,Revisit Choice in a World of Scarcity for more on these terms .,0
4739,Will private firms in a market economy under invest in research and technology ?,0
4740,"If a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment , the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments .",0
4741,"The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .",1
4742,"As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year .",1
4743,Economists and scientists working for Big Drug have compiled a list of potential research and development projects and estimated rates of return .,0
4744,"After all , if the government is spending taxpayer dollars to subsidize public education , society should expect some kind of return on that spending .",0
4745,"Again , economists like George Psacharopoulos have found that , across a variety of nations , the social rate of return on schooling is also positive .",0
4746,"After all , positive externalities exist from investment in education .",0
4747,"Intellectual property rights include patents , which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time , and copyright laws , which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature , music , film / video , and pictures .",1
4748,"For example , if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty - one years , unless the firm with the patent grants permission .",0
4749,"Without a patent , the pharmaceutical firm would have to face competition for any successful products , and could earn no more than a normal rate of profit .",0
4750,"Other institutions , such as the National Academy of Scientists and the National Academy of Engineers , receive federal grants for innovative projects .",0
4751,"The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative ( AFRI ) at the United States Department of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems , from food safety to childhood obesity .",1
4752,"Cooperation between government - funded universities , academies , and the private sector can spur product innovation and create whole new industries .",0
4753,"The second main characteristic of a public good , that it is nonrivalrous , means that when one person uses the public good , another can also use it .",1
4754,"You may recall that 6 x 6 = 36 , 6 x 7 = 42 , and 6 x 8 = 48 .",0
4755,"Memorizing these facts is rehearsal . Another strategy is chunking : you organize information into manageable bits or chunks ( Bodie , Powers , & Fitch - Hauser , 2006 ) .",1
4756,Chunking is useful when trying to remember information like dates and phone numbers .,0
4757,"Use elaborative rehearsal : In a famous article , Craik and Lockhart ( 1972 ) discussed their belief that information we process more deeply goes into long - term memory .",1
4758,Their theory is called levels of processing .,0
4759,"If we want to remember a piece of information , we should think about it more deeply and link it to other information and memories to make it more meaningful .",0
4760,"Cognitive development involves learning , attention , memory , language , thinking , reasoning , and creativity .",1
4761,"Psychosocial development involves emotions , personality , and social relationships .",1
4762,We refer to these domains throughout the chapter .,0
4763,"Not all normative events are universal , meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures .",0
4764,"Biological milestones , such as puberty , tend to be universal , but social milestones , such as the age when children begin formal schooling , are not necessarily universal ; instead , they affect most individuals in a particular culture ( Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ) .",0
4765,"For example , in developed countries children begin school around 5 or 6 years old , but in developing countries , like Nigeria , children often enter school at an advanced age , if at all ( Huebler , 2005 ; United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization [ UNESCO ] , 2013 ) .",0
4766,"How Do Nature and Nurture Influence Development?Are we who we are because of nature ( biology and genetics ) , or are we who we are because of nurture ( our environment and culture ) ? This longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurture debate .",1
4767,"Humans are diverse , and sometimes our differences make it challenging for us to get along with one another .",0
4768,"A poignant example is that of Trayvon Martin , a 17-year - old African American who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer , George Zimmerman , in a predominantly White neighborhood in 2012 .",0
4769,Zimmerman grew suspicious of the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin .,0
4770,"Erik Erikson ( 1902–1994 ) ( [ link ] ) , another stage theorist , took Freud ’s theory and modified it as psychosocial theory .",0
4771,Erikson ’s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature .,0
4772,Piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world .,0
4773,Schemata are concepts ( mental models ) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information .,1
4774,"By the time children have reached adulthood , they have created schemata for almost everything .",0
4775,"The first stage is the sensorimotor stage , which lasts from birth to about 2 years old .",1
4776,"During this stage , children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior .",0
4777,"Kenny ’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces , so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than she did .",0
4778,"Children in this stage can not perform mental operations because they have not developed an understanding of conservation , which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something , it is still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added .",1
4779,"Children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility , which means that objects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition .",1
4780,"Take , for example , water that you poured into the short , fat glass : You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still have the same amount ( minus a couple of drops ) .",0
4781,"After presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas , Kohlberg reviewed people ’s responses and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning ( [ link ] ) .",0
4782,"According to Kohlberg , an individual progresses from the capacity for pre - conventional morality ( before age 9 ) to the capacity for conventional morality ( early adolescence ) , and toward attaining post - conventional morality ( once formal operational thought is attained ) , which only a few fully achieve .",0
4783,"Intrapersonal topics ( those that pertain to the individual ) include emotions and attitudes , the self , and social cognition ( the ways in which we think about ourselves and others ) .",1
4784,"Interpersonal topics ( those that pertain to dyads and groups ) include helping behavior ( [ link ] ) , aggression , prejudice and discrimination , attraction and close relationships , and group processes and intergroup relationships .",1
4785,"In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .",1
4786,An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament .,1
4787,"Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective , whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective .",0
4788,"Therefore , a person ’s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior .",0
4789,"In contrast , people from a collectivistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others , such as family , friends , and community ( [ link ] ) , are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error ( Markus & Kitayama , 1991 ; Triandis , 2001).People from collectivistic cultures , such as some Asian cultures , are more likely to emphasize relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual .",1
4790,"Activities such as ( a ) preparing a meal , ( b ) hanging out , and ( c ) playing a game engage people in a group .",0
4791,"We can understand self - serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution , a belief about the cause of a result .",1
4792,"One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions : locus of control ( internal versus external ) , stability ( stable versus unstable ) , and controllability ( controllable versus uncontrollable ) .",0
4793,A mother and father ’s DNA is passed on to the child at the moment of conception .,0
4794,Conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote ( [ link ] ) .,1
4795,A zygote begins as a one - cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge .,0
4796,"After the zygote divides for about 7–10 days and has 150 cells , it travels down the fallopian tubes and implants itself in the lining of the uterus .",1
4797,"Upon implantation , this multi - cellular organism is called an embryo .",0
4798,"Now blood vessels grow , forming the placenta .",0
4799,"A teratogen is any environmental agent — biological , chemical , or physical — that causes damage to the developing embryo or fetus .",1

4801,Motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects .,1
4802,"Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .",1
4803,"In social and emotional development , forming healthy attachments is very important and is the major social milestone of infancy .",0
4804,Attachment is a long - standing connection or bond with others .,1
4805,Developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone .,0
4806,"With avoidant attachment , the child is unresponsive to the parent , does not use the parent as a secure base , and does not care if the parent leaves .",1
4807,The toddler reacts to the parent the same way she reacts to a stranger .,0
4808,"Baumrind developed and refined a theory describing four parenting styles : authoritative , authoritarian , permissive , and uninvolved .",0
4809,"With the authoritative style , the parent gives reasonable demands and consistent limits , expresses warmth and affection , and listens to the child ’s point of view .",1
4810,Parents set rules and explain the reasons behind them .,0
4811,"With the uninvolved style of parenting , the parents are indifferent , uninvolved , and sometimes referred to as neglectful .",1
4812,They do n’t respond to the child ’s needs and make relatively few demands .,0
4813,"While the sequence of physical changes in puberty is predictable , the onset and pace of puberty vary widely .",0
4814,"Several physical changes occur during puberty , such as adrenarche and gonadarche , the maturing of the adrenal glands and sex glands , respectively .",0
4815,"Also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature .",0
4816,"Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .",1
4817,"Girls experience menarche , the beginning of menstrual periods , usually around 12–13 years old , and boys experience spermarche , the first ejaculation , around 13–14 years old .",1
4818,Another aspect of positive aging is believed to be social connectedness and social support .,0
4819,"As we get older , socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our social support and friendships dwindle in number , but remain as close , if not more close than in our earlier years ( Carstensen , 1992 ) ( [ link ] ) .",1
4820,This shared knowledge comes from social norms .,0
4821,"A social norm is a group ’s expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members — how they are supposed to behave and think ( Deutsch & Gerard , 1955 ; Berkowitz , 2004 ) .",1

4825,Now we turn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs .,0
4826,"Attitude is our evaluation of a person , an idea , or an object .",1
4827,We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies .,0

4832,"After the war , Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University .",0
4833,The central route is logic driven and uses data and facts to convince people of an argument ’s worthiness .,0
4834,"For example , a car company seeking to persuade you to purchase their model will emphasize the car ’s safety features and fuel economy .",0
4835,Solomon Asch conducted several experiments in the 1950s to determine how people are affected by the thoughts and behaviors of other people .,0
4836,"In one study , a group of participants was shown a series of printed line segments of different lengths : a , b , and c ( [ link ] ) .",0
4837,The Asch effect is the influence of the group majority on an individual ’s judgment . What factors make a person more likely to yield to group pressure ?,1
4838,"Research shows that the size of the majority , the presence of another dissenter , and the public or relatively private nature of responses are key influences on conformity .",0
4839,"In normative social influence , people conform to the group norm to fit in , to feel good , and to be accepted by the group .",1
4840,"However , with informational social influence , people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information , particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous .",1
4841,What type of social influence was operating in the Asch conformity studies ?,0
4842,Several variations of the original Milgram experiment were conducted to test the boundaries of obedience .,0
4843,"When certain features of the situation were changed , participants were less likely to continue to deliver shocks ( Milgram , 1965 ) .",0
4844,Sometimes being in a group situation can improve performance .,0
4845,Social facilitation occurs when an individual performs better when an audience is watching than when the individual performs the behavior alone .,1
4846,This typically occurs when people are performing a task for which they are skilled .,0
4847,"The field of I - O psychology can be divided into three broad areas ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) : industrial , organizational , and human factors .",0
4848,Industrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and assessing individuals for their ability to meet those requirements .,1
4849,"In addition , once employees are hired , industrial psychology studies and develops ways to train , evaluate , and respond to those evaluations .",0
4850,"Scott was one of the first psychologists to apply psychology to advertising , management , and personnel selection .",0
4851,"In 1903 , Scott published two books : The Theory of Advertising and Psychology of Advertising .",0
4852,"Parallel to these studies in industrial and organizational psychology , the field of human factors psychology was also developing .",0
4853,Frederick Taylor was an engineer who saw that if one could redesign the workplace there would be an increase in both output for the company and wages for the workers .,0
4854,"In 1911 he put forward his theory in a book titled , The Principles of Scientific Management ( [ link ] ) .",0
4855,"These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile , which may lead to prejudice toward people who are different .",0
4856,"Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a particular social group ( Allport , 1954 ; Brown , 2010 ) .",1
4857,Prejudice is common against people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group .,0
4858,"Racism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one ’s membership in a specific racial group ( such as toward African Americans , Asian Americans , Latinos , Native Americans , European Americans ) .",1
4859,What are some stereotypes of various racial or ethnic groups ?,0
4860,Another form of prejudice is homophobia : prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation .,1
4861,"Like ageism , homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people ( Herek & McLemore , 2013 ; Nosek , 2005 ) .",0
4862,"When we hold a stereotype about a person , we have expectations that he or she will fulfill that stereotype .",0
4863,A self - fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true .,1
4864,These groups serve as our in - groups .,0
4865,An in - group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to .,1
4866,"A group that we do n’t belong to , or an out - group , is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us .",1
4867,This often happens by blaming an out - group for the problem .,0
4868,"Scapegoating is the act of blaming an out - group when the in - group experiences frustration or is blocked from obtaining a goal ( Allport , 1954 ) .",1
4869,Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression .,1
4870,"In contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain ( Berkowitz , 1993 ) ; a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression .",1
4871,"Although there is not one single personality profile for who becomes a bully and who becomes a victim of bullying ( APA , 2010 ) , researchers have identified some patterns in children who are at a greater risk of being bullied ( Olweus , 1993 ) :",0
4872,"Based on this case , researchers Latané and Darley ( 1968 ) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect .",0
4873,The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress .,1
4874,"Instead , they just watch what is happening .",0
4875,Research suggests there are many other reasons .,0
4876,Altruism is people ’s desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping .,1
4877,"In fact , people acting in altruistic ways may disregard the personal costs associated with helping ( [ link ] ) .",0
4878,"Once we form relationships with people , we desire reciprocity .",0
4879,Reciprocity is the give and take in relationships .,1
4880,"We contribute to relationships , but we expect to receive benefits as well .",0
4881,"Sternberg ( 1986 ) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love — intimacy , passion , and commitment — which is described as consummate love ( [ link ] ) .",1
4882,"However , different aspects of love might be more prevalent at different life stages .",0
4883,One theory that provides an explanation is social exchange theory .,0
4884,"According to social exchange theory , we act as naïve economists in keeping a tally of the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others ( [ link ] ) ( Rusbult & Van Lange , 2003 ) .",1
4885,You might be wondering if psychology research can tell you how to succeed in a job interview .,0
4886,"As you can imagine , most research is concerned with the employer ’s interest in choosing the most appropriate candidate for the job , a goal that makes sense for the candidate too .",0
4887,"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal to treat individuals unfavorably because of their race or color of their skin : An employer can not discriminate based on skin color , hair texture , or other immutable characteristics , which are traits of an individual that are fundamental to her identity , in hiring , benefits , promotions , or termination of employees .",1
4888,"The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amends the Civil Rights Act ; it prohibits job ( e.g. , employment , pay , and termination ) discrimination of a woman because she is pregnant as long as she can perform the work required .",1
4889,Organizational psychology is the second major branch of study and practice within the discipline of industrial and organizational psychology .,0
4890,"In organizational psychology , the focus is on social interactions and their effect on the individual and on the functioning of the organization .",1
4891,"In this section , you will learn about the work organizational psychologists have done to understand job satisfaction , different styles of management , different styles of leadership , organizational culture , and teamwork .",0
4892,"Downsizing is an increasingly common response to a business ’s pronounced failure to achieve profit goals , and it involves laying off a significant percentage of the company ’s employees .",1
4893,"Industrial - organizational psychologists may be involved in all aspects of downsizing : how the news is delivered to employees ( both those being let go and those staying ) , how laid - off employees are supported ( e.g. , separation packages ) , and how retained employees are supported .",0
4894,A significant portion of I - O research focuses on management and human relations .,0
4895,"Douglas McGregor ( 1960 ) combined scientific management ( a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflows with the main objective of improving economic efficiency , especially labor productivity ) and human relations into the notion of leadership behavior .",1
4896,His theory lays out two different styles called Theory X and Theory Y .,0
4897,Bass ( 1985 ) popularized and developed the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles .,0
4898,"In transactional leadership , the focus is on supervision and organizational goals , which are achieved through a system of rewards and punishments ( i.e. , transactions ) .",1
4899,Transactional leaders maintain the status quo : They are managers .,1
4900,Each company and organization has an organizational culture .,0
4901,"Organizational culture encompasses the values , visions , hierarchies , norms , and interactions among its employees .",1
4902,"It is how an organization is run , how it operates , and how it makes decisions — the industry in which the organization participates may have an influence .",0
4903,The U.S .,0
4904,Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( n.d . ) provides the following description of sexual harassment :,0
4905,"Whereas the two other areas of I - O psychology focus on the interface between the worker and team , group , or organization , human factors psychology focuses on the individual worker ’s interaction with a machine , work station , information displays , and the local environment , such as lighting .",1
4906,"In the United States , human factors psychology has origins in both psychology and engineering ; this is reflected in the early contributions of Lillian Gilbreth ( psychologist and engineer ) and her husband Frank Gilbreth ( engineer ) .",0
4907,These conceptualizations are referred to as response - based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions .,0
4908,"For example , the endocrinologist Hans Selye , a famous stress researcher , once defined stress as the “ response of the body to any demand , whether it is caused by , or results in , pleasant or unpleasant conditions ” ( Selye , 1976 , p. 74 ) .",1
4909,Selye ’s definition of stress is response - based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body ’s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it .,0
4910,Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals .,0
4911,A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well - being that a stressor might entail .,1
4912,"A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm , loss , or other negative consequence ; conversely , a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth .",0
4913,"A person at this stress level is colloquially at the top of his game , meaning he feels fully energized , focused , and can work with minimal effort and maximum efficiency .",0
4914,"But when stress exceeds this optimal level , it is no longer a positive force — it becomes excessive and debilitating , or what Selye termed distress ( from the Latin dis = “ bad ” ) .",1
4915,"People who reach this level of stress feel burned out ; they are fatigued , exhausted , and their performance begins to decline .",0
4916,"Your heart starts to pound and speeds up , you begin to breathe heavily and perspire , you get butterflies in your stomach , and your muscles become tense , preparing you to take some kind of direct action .",0
4917,"Cannon proposed that this reaction , which he called the fight - or - flight response , occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions — especially those associated with a perceived threat ( Cannon , 1932 ) .",1
4918,"During the fight - or - flight response , the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system ( [ link ] ) .",0
4919,"The general adaptation syndrome , shown in [ link ] , consists of three stages : ( 1 ) alarm reaction , ( 2 ) stage of resistance , and ( 3 ) stage of exhaustion ( Selye , 1936 ; 1976 ) .",0
4920,"Alarm reaction describes the body ’s immediate reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency , and it is roughly analogous to the fight - or - flight response described by Cannon .",1
4921,"During an alarm reaction , you are alerted to a stressor , and your body alarms you with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation .",0
4922,What goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress ?,0
4923,"The physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex , but they generally involve the work of two systems — the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis .",0
4924,"When a person first perceives something as stressful ( Selye ’s alarm reaction ) , the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands .",0
4925,"The sociocultural perspective looks at you , your behaviors , and your symptoms in the context of your culture and background .",1
4926,"For example , José is an 18-year - old Hispanic male from a traditional family .",0
4927,"In the 1960s , psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life routines are stressful , whether these events are desirable or undesirable .",0
4928,"They developed the Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) , consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment ( Holmes & Rahe , 1967 ) .",0
4929,Potential stressors do not always involve major life events .,0
4930,"Daily hassles — the minor irritations and annoyances that are part of our everyday lives ( e.g. , rush hour traffic , lost keys , obnoxious coworkers , inclement weather , arguments with friends or family)—can build on one another and leave us just as stressed as life change events ( [ link ] ) ( Kanner , Coyne , Schaefer , & Lazarus , 1981 ) .",0
4931,This helps explain why relapse rates tend to be high .,0
4932,"About 40%–60 % of individuals relapse , which means they return to abusing drugs and/or alcohol after a period of improvement ( National Institute on Drug Abuse [ NIDA ] , 2008 ) .",1
4933,"In this section , we will discuss stress and illness .",0
4934,"As stress researcher Robert Sapolsky ( 1998 ) describes ,",0
4935,"In addition , the immune system may sometimes break down and be unable to do its job .",0
4936,"This situation is referred to as immunosuppression , the decreased effectiveness of the immune system .",1
4937,"When people experience immunosuppression , they become susceptible to any number of infections , illness , and diseases .",0
4938,"Shortened telomeres can inhibit or block cell division , which includes growth and proliferation of new cells , thereby leading to more rapid aging ( Sapolsky , 2004 ) .",0
4939,"In the study , researchers compared telomere lengths in the white blood cells in mothers of chronically ill children to those of mothers of healthy children ( Epel et al . , 2004 ) .",0
4940,Mothers of chronically ill children would be expected to experience more stress than would mothers of healthy children .,0
4941,These individuals tend to be intensively driven workaholics who are preoccupied with deadlines and always seem to be in a rush .,1
4942,"According to Friedman and Rosenman , these individuals exhibit Type A behavior pattern ; those who are more relaxed and laid - back were characterized as Type B ( [ link ] ) .",1
4943,"In a sample of Type As and Type Bs , Friedman and Rosenman were startled to discover that heart disease was over seven times more frequent among the Type As than the Type Bs ( Friedman & Rosenman , 1959 ) .",0
4944,"Perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was Benjamin Malzberg ( 1937 ) , who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia ( an archaic term for depression ) was six times higher than that of the population .",1
4945,"A classic study in the late 1970s looked at over 8,000 manic - depressive persons in Denmark , finding a nearly 50 % increase in deaths from heart disease among these patients compared with the general Danish population ( Weeke , 1979 ) .",0
4946,"The therapist informs the client about confidentiality , fees , and what to expect in treatment .",0
4947,Confidentiality means the therapist can not disclose confidential communications to any third party unless mandated or permitted by law to do so .,1
4948,"During the intake , the therapist and client will work together to discuss treatment goals .",0
4949,Couples therapy involves two people in an intimate relationship who are having difficulties and are trying to resolve them ( [ link ] ) .,1
4950,"The couple may be dating , partnered , engaged , or married .",0
4951,"In strategic family therapy , the goal is to address specific problems within the family that can be dealt with in a relatively short amount of time .",1
4952,"Typically , the therapist would guide what happens in the therapy session and design a detailed approach to resolving each member ’s problem ( Madanes , 1991 ) .",0
4953,Psychoanalysis was developed by Sigmund Freud and was the first form of psychotherapy .,0
4954,"It was the dominant therapeutic technique in the early 20th century , but it has since waned significantly in popularity .",0
4955,"Freud suggested that during this patient - therapist relationship , the patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist — maybe positive feelings , maybe negative feelings .",0
4956,Freud called this transference : the patient transfers all the positive or negative emotions associated with the patient ’s other relationships to the psychoanalyst .,1
4957,"For example , Crystal is seeing a psychoanalyst .",0
4958,"In psychoanalysis , therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings .",1
4959,"In behavior therapy , a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors — rather than digging deeply into one ’s unconscious .",1
4960,Two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy .,0
4961,Aversive conditioning uses an unpleasant stimulus to stop an undesirable behavior .,1
4962,"Therapists apply this technique to eliminate addictive behaviors , such as smoking , nail biting , and drinking .",0
4963,"Sometimes , it ’s too impractical , expensive , or embarrassing to re - create anxiety- producing situations , so a therapist might employ virtual reality exposure therapy by using a simulation to help conquer fears .",0
4964,"Virtual reality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as the fear of public speaking , claustrophobia ( fear of enclosed spaces ) , aviophobia ( fear of flying ) , and post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , a trauma and stressor - related disorder ( Gerardi , Cukor , Difede , Rizzo , & Rothbaum , 2010 ) .",1
4965,Cognitive therapy was developed by psychiatrist Aaron Beck in the 1960s .,0
4966,"His initial focus was on depression and how a client ’s self - defeating attitude served to maintain a depression despite positive factors in her life ( Beck , Rush , Shaw , & Emery , 1979 ) ( [ link ] ) .",0
4967,Humanistic psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential .,1
4968,So it makes sense that the goal of humanistic therapy is to help people become more self - aware and accepting of themselves .,0
4969,"In contrast to psychoanalysis , humanistic therapists focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts .",0
4970,"In active listening , the therapist acknowledges , restates , and clarifies what the client expresses .",0
4971,"Therapists also practice what Rogers called unconditional positive regard , which involves not judging clients and simply accepting them for who they are .",1
4972,"Rogers ( 1951 ) also felt that therapists should demonstrate genuineness , empathy , and acceptance toward their clients because this helps people become more accepting of themselves , which results in personal growth .",0
4973,"As we learned in the previous section , stress — especially if it is chronic — takes a toll on our bodies and can have enormously negative health implications .",0
4974,"When we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful , it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress .",0
4975,"These efforts may include avoiding , minimizing , or distancing oneself from the problem , or positive comparisons with others ( “ I ’m not as bad off as she is ” ) , or seeking something positive in a negative event ( “ Now that I ’ve been fired , I can sleep in for a few days ” ) .",0
4976,"In some cases , emotion - focused coping strategies involve reappraisal , whereby the stressor is construed differently ( and somewhat self - deceptively ) without changing its objective level of threat ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .",1
4977,"For example , a person sentenced to federal prison who thinks , “ This will give me a great chance to network with others , ” is using reappraisal .",0
4978,"Building strong interpersonal relationships with others helps us establish a network of close , caring individuals who can provide social support in times of distress , sorrow , and fear .",0
4979,"Social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends , family , and acquaintances ( Baron & Kerr , 2003 ) .",1
4980,"Social support can take many forms , including advice , guidance , encouragement , acceptance , emotional comfort , and tangible assistance ( such as financial help ) .",0
4981,"Beyond having a sense of control and establishing social support networks , there are numerous other means by which we can manage stress ( [ link ] ) .",0
4982,"A common technique people use to combat stress is exercise ( Salmon , 2001 ) .",0
4983,"It is well - established that exercise , both of long ( aerobic ) and short ( anaerobic ) duration , is beneficial for both physical and mental health ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .",0
4984,"The relaxation response approach is conceptualized as a general approach to stress reduction that reduces sympathetic arousal , and it has been used effectively to treat people with high blood pressure ( Benson & Proctor , 1994 ) .",1
4985,"Another technique to combat stress , biofeedback , was developed by Gary Schwartz at Harvard University in the early 1970s .",0
4986,Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a person ’s neuromuscular and autonomic activity — feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals .,1
4987,"Measuring happiness and well - being at the societal level over time may assist policy makers in determining if people are generally happy or miserable , as well as when and why they might feel the way they do .",0
4988,"Studies show that average national happiness scores ( over time and across countries ) relate strongly to six key variables : per capita gross domestic product ( GDP , which reflects a nation ’s economic standard of living ) , social support , freedom to make important life choices , healthy life expectancy , freedom from perceived corruption in government and business , and generosity ( Helliwell et al . , 2013 ) .",0
4989,"Qualities that help promote psychological well - being ( e.g. , having meaning and purpose in life , a sense of autonomy , positive emotions , and satisfaction with life ) are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes ( especially improved cardiovascular health ) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors ( such as diet , physical activity , and sleep quality ) ( Boehm & Kubzansky , 2012 ) .",0
4990,"The quality that has received attention is positive affect , which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment , such as happiness , joy , enthusiasm , alertness , and excitement ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) .",1
4991,"The characteristics of positive affect , as with negative affect ( discussed earlier ) , can be brief , long - lasting , or trait - like ( Pressman & Cohen , 2005 ) .",0
4992,"By the 18th century , people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums ( [ link ] ) .",0
4993,"Asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological disorders , but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders .",1
4994,"Often these people were kept in windowless dungeons , beaten , chained to their beds , and had little to no contact with caregivers .",0
4995,This legislation changed how mental health services were delivered in the United States .,0
4996,"It started the process of deinstitutionalization , the closing of large asylums , by providing for people to stay in their communities and be treated locally .",1
4997,"In 1955 , there were 558,239 severely mentally ill patients institutionalized at public hospitals ( Torrey , 1997 ) .",0
4998,"However , there are a group of conditions that , when present , are diagnosed early in childhood , often before the time a child enters school .",0
4999,"These conditions are listed in the DSM-5 as neurodevelopmental disorders , and they involve developmental problems in personal , social , academic , and intellectual functioning ( APA , 2013 ) .",1
5000,"In this section , we will discuss two such disorders : attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and autism .",0
5001,"The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger ’s disorder , generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder ; individuals diagnosed with Asperger ’s disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary , but exhibiting impairments in social interaction and social communication , such as talking only about their special interests ( Wing , Gould , & Gillberg , 2011 ) .",0
5002,"However , because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger ’s disorder differs qualitatively from autistic disorder , the DSM-5 does not include it , which is prompting concerns among some parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services ( “ Asperger ’s Syndrome Dropped , ” 2012 ) .",0
5003,"Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder , particularly those with better language and intellectual skills , can live and work independently as adults .",0
5004,Amnesia refers to the partial or total forgetting of some experience or event .,1
5005,"An individual with dissociative amnesia is unable to recall important personal information , usually following an extremely stressful or traumatic experience such as combat , natural disasters , or being the victim of violence .",1
5006,"Try this fun activity that employs a memory - enhancing strategy . You could also enhance memory by using elaborative rehearsal : a technique in which you think about the meaning of the new information and its relation to knowledge already stored in your memory ( Tigner , 1999 ) .",1
5007,"For example , in this case , you could remember that 520 is an area code for Arizona and the person you met is from Arizona .",0
5008,"Across these three domains — physical , cognitive , and psychosocial — the normative approach to development is also discussed .",0
5009,"This approach asks , “ What is normal development ? ” In the early decades of the 20th century , normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms ( i.e. , average ages ) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains ( Gesell , 1933 , 1939 , 1940 ; Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ; Hall , 1904 ) .",0
5010,"Continuous development views development as a cumulative process , gradually improving on existing skills ( [ link ] ) .",1
5011,"With this type of development , there is gradual change .",0
5012,"In the field of behavioral genetics , the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart — a well - known study of the genetic basis for personality — conducted research with twins from 1979 to 1999 .",1
5013,"In studying 350 pairs of twins , including pairs of identical and fraternal twins reared together and apart , researchers found that identical twins , whether raised together or apart , have very similar personalities ( Bouchard , 1994 ; Bouchard , Lykken , McGue , Segal , & Tellegen , 1990 ; Segal , 2012 ) .",0
5014,Sigmund Freud ( 1856–1939 ) believed that personality develops during early childhood .,0
5015,"For Freud , childhood experiences shape our personalities and behavior as adults .",0
5016,"Erik Erikson ( 1902–1994 ) ( [ link ] ) , another stage theorist , took Freud ’s theory and modified it as psychosocial theory .",0
5017,Erikson ’s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature .,1
5018,"While Freud believed that personality is shaped only in childhood , Erikson proposed that personality development takes place all through the lifespan .",0
5019,"Young children put objects in their mouths to see if the items are edible , and once they can grasp objects , they may shake or bang them to see if they make sounds .",0
5020,"Between 5 and 8 months old , the child develops object permanence , which is the understanding that even if something is out of sight , it still exists ( Bogartz , Shinskey , & Schilling , 2000 ) .",1
5021,"According to Piaget , young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight .",0
5022,"During this stage , we also expect children to display egocentrism , which means that the child is not able to take the perspective of others .",1
5023,"A child at this stage thinks that everyone sees , thinks , and feels just as they do .",0
5024,"The fourth , and last , stage in Piaget ’s theory is the formal operational stage , which is from about age 11 to adulthood .",0
5025,"Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about concrete events , children in the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations .",1
5026,Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one influence or behavior over others .,0
5027,Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and surroundings .,1
5028,"In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) .",1
5029,"They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables , and thus to the person ’s state .",1
5030,"This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error ( Ross , 1977 ; Riggio & Garcia , 2009 ) .",0
5031,"To better understand , imagine this scenario : Greg returns home from work , and upon opening the front door his wife happily greets him and inquires about his day .",0
5032,You might say you were very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time — a situational explanation .,0
5033,"The actor - observer bias is the phenomenon of attributing other people ’s behavior to internal factors ( fundamental attribution error ) while attributing our own behavior to situational forces ( Jones & Nisbett , 1971 ; Nisbett , Caputo , Legant , & Marecek , 1973 ; Choi & Nisbett , 1998 ) .",1
5034,"As actors of behavior , we have more information available to explain our own behavior .",0
5035,"A common ideology , or worldview , in the United States is the just - world hypothesis .",0
5036,"The just - world hypothesis is the belief that people get the outcomes they deserve ( Lerner & Miller , 1978 ) .",1
5037,"In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place , people tend to think that good people experience positive outcomes , and bad people experience negative outcomes ( Jost , Banaji , & Nosek , 2004 ; Jost & Major , 2001 ) .",0
5038,Conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote ( [ link ] ) .,1
5039,A zygote begins as a one - cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge .,1
5040,The genetic makeup and sex of the baby are set at this point .,0
5041,"Now blood vessels grow , forming the placenta .",0
5042,The placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that provides nourishment and oxygen from the mother to the developing embryo via the umbilical cord .,1
5043,"Basic structures of the embryo start to develop into areas that will become the head , chest , and abdomen .",0
5044,"Each organ of the fetus develops during a specific period in the pregnancy , called the critical or sensitive period ( [ link ] ) .",1
5045,"For example , research with primate models of FASD has demonstrated that the time during which a developing fetus is exposed to alcohol can dramatically affect the appearance of facial characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome .",0
5046,Motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects .,1
5047,"Fine motor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers , toes , and eyes , and enable coordination of small actions ( e.g. , grasping a toy , writing with a pencil , and using a spoon ) .",1
5048,"Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements ( e.g. , balancing , running , and jumping ) .",1
5049,He used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child ( 1988 ) .,0
5050,A secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he explores his surroundings .,1
5051,"Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment : The caregiver must be responsive to the child ’s physical , social , and emotional needs ; and the caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions ( Bowlby , 1969 ) ( [ link ] ) .",0
5052,"In cases of resistant attachment , children tend to show clingy behavior , but then they reject the attachment figure ’s attempts to interact with them ( Ainsworth & Bell , 1970 ) .",1
5053,"These children do not explore the toys in the room , as they are too fearful .",0
5054,"In authoritarian style , the parent places high value on conformity and obedience .",1
5055,"The parents are often strict , tightly monitor their children , and express little warmth .",0
5056,"As you can see , parenting styles influence childhood adjustment , but could a child ’s temperament likewise influence parenting ?",0
5057,"Temperament refers to innate traits that influence how one thinks , behaves , and reacts with the environment .",1
5058,"Children with easy temperaments demonstrate positive emotions , adapt well to change , and are capable of regulating their emotions .",0
5059,"Also during this time , primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature .",0
5060,"Primary sexual characteristics are organs specifically needed for reproduction , like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males .",1
5061,"Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs , such as development of breasts and hips in girls , and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in boys .",1
5062,"Cognitive empathy , also known as theory - of - mind ( which we discussed earlier with regard to egocentrism ) , relates to the ability to take the perspective of others and feel concern for others ( Shamay - Tsoory , Tomer , & Aharon - Peretz , 2005 ) .",1
5063,Cognitive empathy begins to increase in adolescence and is an important component of social problem solving and conflict avoidance .,0
5064,"In contrast , until about 50 years ago in the United States , a doctor might not inform someone that they were dying , and the majority of deaths occurred in hospitals .",0
5065,"In 1967 that reality began to change with Cicely Saunders , who created the first modern hospice in England .",0
5066,"The aim of hospice is to help provide a death with dignity and pain management in a humane and comfortable environment , which is usually outside of a hospital setting .",1

5072,"Often , our behavior , attitudes , and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self - esteem or positive self - image .",0
5073,"Psychologist Leon Festinger ( 1957 ) defined cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes , behaviors , or cognitions ( thoughts , beliefs , or opinions ) .",1
5074,"Festinger ’s theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors , attitudes , or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self - perceptions , we experience psychological discomfort ( dissonance ) .",1
5075,"Besides the classic military example and group initiation , can you think of other examples of cognitive dissonance ?",0
5076,"Here is one : Marco and Maria live in Fairfield County , Connecticut , which is one of the wealthiest areas in the United States and has a very high cost of living .",0
5077,"After the war , Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University .",0
5078,"Out of this work came a model called the Yale attitude change approach , which describes the conditions under which people tend to change their attitudes .",0
5079,"Hovland demonstrated that certain features of the source of a persuasive message , the content of the message , and the characteristics of the audience will influence the persuasiveness of a message ( Hovland , Janis , & Kelley , 1953 ) .",0
5080,"The peripheral route is an indirect route that uses peripheral cues to associate positivity with the message ( Petty & Cacioppo , 1986 ) .",1
5081,"Instead of focusing on the facts and a product ’s quality , the peripheral route relies on association with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and celebrity endorsement .",0
5082,The remaining members of the group were confederates of the researcher .,0
5083,A confederate is a person who is aware of the experiment and works for the researcher .,1
5084,"Confederates are used to manipulate social situations as part of the research design , and the true , naïve participants believe that confederates are , like them , uninformed participants in the experiment .",0
5085,"The finding that conformity is more likely to occur when responses are public than when they are private is the reason government elections require voting in secret , so we are not coerced by others ( [ link ] ) .",0
5086,The Asch effect can be easily seen in children when they have to publicly vote for something .,0
5087,"For example , if the teacher asks whether the children would rather have extra recess , no homework , or candy , once a few children vote , the rest will comply and go with the majority .",0
5088,Another form of social influence is obedience to authority .,0
5089,Obedience is the change of an individual ’s behavior to comply with a demand by an authority figure .,1
5090,People often comply with the request because they are concerned about a consequence if they do not comply .,0
5091,Another phenomenon of group conformity is groupthink .,0
5092,"Groupthink is the modification of the opinions of members of a group to align with what they believe is the group consensus ( Janis , 1972 ) .",1
5093,"In group situations , the group often takes action that individuals would not perform outside the group setting because groups make more extreme decisions than individuals do .",0
5094,Social LoafingAnother way in which a group presence can affect our performance is social loafing .,0
5095,Social loafing is the exertion of less effort by a person working together with a group .,1
5096,Social loafing occurs when our individual performance can not be evaluated separately from the group .,0
5097,"As a consequence of its concern for candidate characteristics , industrial psychology must also consider issues of legality regarding discrimination in hiring .",0
5098,Organizational psychology is a discipline interested in how the relationships among employees affect those employees and the performance of a business .,1
5099,"This includes studying worker satisfaction , motivation , and commitment .",0
5100,The involvement of the United States in World War I in April 1917 catalyzed the participation in the military effort of psychologists working in this area .,0
5101,At that time Yerkes was the president of the 25-year - old American Psychological Association ( APA ) .,0
5102,The APA is a professional association in the United States for clinical and research psychologists .,1
5103,Gilbreth was another influential I - O psychologist who strove to find ways to increase productivity ( [ link ] ) .,0
5104,"Using time and motion studies , Gilbreth and her husband , Frank , worked to make workers more efficient by reducing the number of motions required to perform a task .",0
5105,How did your prejudice develop ?,0
5106,"Prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype — that is , a specific belief or assumption about individuals based solely on their membership in a group , regardless of their individual characteristics .",1
5107,Stereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group .,0
5108,Sexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex .,1
5109,"Typically , sexism takes the form of men holding biases against women , but either sex can show sexism toward their own or their opposite sex .",0
5110,Another form of prejudice is homophobia : prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation .,1
5111,"Like ageism , homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people ( Herek & McLemore , 2013 ; Nosek , 2005 ) .",0
5112,"Negative feelings often result in discrimination , such as the exclusion of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) people from social groups and the avoidance of LGBT neighbors and co - workers .",0
5113,"When we hold a stereotype about a person , we have expectations that he or she will fulfill that stereotype .",0
5114,A self - fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters his or her behavior in a way that tends to make it true .,1
5115,"When we hold stereotypes about a person , we tend to treat the person according to our expectations .",0
5116,An in - group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to .,1
5117,"A group that we do n’t belong to , or an out - group , is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us .",1
5118,"For example , if you are female , your gender in - group includes all females , and your gender out - group includes all males ( [ link ] ) .",0
5119,Humans engage in aggression when they seek to cause harm or pain to another person .,0
5120,Aggression takes two forms depending on one ’s motives : hostile or instrumental .,1
5121,"For example , women may express their aggression covertly , for example , by communication that impairs the social standing of another person .",0
5122,"Another theory that explains one of the functions of human aggression is frustration aggression theory ( Dollard , Doob , Miller , Mowrer , & Sears , 1939 ) .",0
5123,"This theory states that when humans are prevented from achieving an important goal , they become frustrated and aggressive .",1
5124,"With the rapid growth of technology , and widely available mobile technology and social networking media , a new form of bullying has emerged : cyberbullying ( Hoff & Mitchell , 2009 ) .",0
5125,"Cyberbullying , like bullying , is repeated behavior that is intended to cause psychological or emotional harm to another person .",1
5126,"What is unique about cyberbullying is that it is typically covert , concealed , done in private , and the bully can remain anonymous .",0
5127,Social psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation .,0
5128,"Diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group ( Bandura , 1999 ) .",1
5129,"Because there were many witnesses to the attack on Genovese , as evidenced by the number of lit apartment windows in the building , individuals assumed someone else must have already called the police .",0
5130,Some researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy .,0
5131,"Empathy is the capacity to understand another person ’s perspective , to feel what he or she feels .",1
5132,"An empathetic person makes an emotional connection with others and feels compelled to help ( Batson , 1991 ) .",0
5133,Self - disclosure is part of the two way street .,0
5134,"Self - disclosure is the sharing of personal information ( Laurenceau , Barrett , & Pietromonaco , 1998 ) .",1
5135,We form more intimate connections with people with whom we disclose important information about ourselves .,0
5136,Empty love is having commitment without intimacy or passion .,1

5138,"Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy , but no commitment .",1
5139,"Performance appraisals are typically documented several times a year , often with a formal process and an annual face - to - face brief meeting between an employee and his supervisor .",0
5140,It is important that the original job analysis play a role in performance appraisal as well as any goals that have been set by the employee or by the employee and supervisor .,0
5141,The Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) of 1990 states people may not be discriminated against due to the nature of their disability .,1
5142,"A disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities such as hearing , walking , and breathing .",1
5143,"Some people love their jobs , some people tolerate their jobs , and some people can not stand their jobs .",0
5144,Job satisfaction describes the degree to which individuals enjoy their job .,1
5145,It was described by Edwin Locke ( 1976 ) as the state of feeling resulting from appraising one ’s job experiences .,0
5146,"Many people juggle the demands of work life with the demands of their home life , whether it be caring for children or taking care of an elderly parent ; this is known as work - family balance .",1
5147,"We might commonly think about work interfering with family , but it is also the case that family responsibilities may conflict with work obligations ( Carlson , Kacmar , & Williams , 2000 ) .",0
5148,His theory lays out two different styles called Theory X and Theory Y .,0
5149,"In the Theory X approach to management , managers assume that most people dislike work and are not innately self - directed .",1
5150,Theory X managers perceive employees as people who prefer to be led and told which tasks to perform and when .,0
5151,This is in contrast to the transformational leader .,0
5152,"People who have transformational leadership possess four attributes to varying degrees : They are charismatic ( highly liked role models ) , inspirational ( optimistic about goal attainment ) , intellectually stimulating ( encourage critical thinking and problem solving ) , and considerate ( Bass , Avolio , & Atwater , 1996 ) .",1
5153,Many workplaces offer diversity training to help everyone involved bridge and understand cultural differences .,0
5154,Diversity training educates participants about cultural differences with the goal of improving teamwork .,1
5155,"There is always the potential for prejudice between members of two groups , but the evidence suggests that simply working together , particularly if the conditions of work are set carefully that such prejudice can be reduced or eliminated .",0
5156,Workplace violence is one aspect of workplace safety that I - O psychologists study .,0
5157,"Workplace violence is any act or threat of physical violence , harassment , intimidation , or other threatening , disruptive behavior that occurs at the workplace .",1
5158,"It ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults and even homicide ( Occupational Safety & Health Administration , 2014 ) .",0
5159,One of the methods used to reduce accidents in the workplace is a checklist .,0
5160,The airline industry is one industry that uses checklists .,0
5161,"A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well - being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) .",1
5162,"A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — demanding or threatening events ( often referred to as stressors ) ; these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events .",0
5163,"The perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal : judgment of the options available to cope with a stressor , as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be ( Lyon , 2012 ) ( [ link ] ) .",1
5164,"As you may recall from what you learned about self - efficacy , an individual ’s belief in his ability to complete a task is important ( Bandura , 1994 ) .",1
5165,"Selye and the General Adaptation SyndromeAnother important early contributor to the stress field was Hans Selye , mentioned earlier .",0
5166,He would eventually become one of the world ’s foremost experts in the study of stress ( [ link ] ) .,0
5167,"If exposure to a stressor is prolonged , the organism will enter the stage of resistance .",0
5168,"During this stage , the initial shock of alarm reaction has worn off and the body has adapted to the stressor .",1
5169,"The ACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream ; an important one is cortisol , which can affect virtually every organ within the body .",0
5170,"Cortisol is commonly known as a stress hormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor , preparing us to run away or fight .",1
5171,"However , sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system .",0
5172,"As our society becomes increasingly multiethnic and multiracial , mental health professionals must develop cultural competence ( [ link ] ) , which means they must understand and address issues of race , culture , and ethnicity .",1
5173,"They must also develop strategies to effectively address the needs of various populations for which Eurocentric therapies have limited application ( Sue , 2004 ) .",0
5174,"In the 1960s , psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness , based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a person ’s normal life routines are stressful , whether these events are desirable or undesirable .",0
5175,"They developed the Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) , consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment ( Holmes & Rahe , 1967 ) .",1
5176,"Many life events that most people would consider pleasant ( e.g. , holidays , retirement , marriage ) are among those listed on the SRRS ; these are examples of eustress .",0
5177,"Although the specific stressors for these occupations are diverse , they seem to share two common denominators : heavy workload and uncertainty about and lack of control over certain aspects of a job .",0
5178,"Both of these factors contribute to job strain , a work situation that combines excessive job demands and workload with little discretion in decision making or job control ( Karasek & Theorell , 1990 ) .",1
5179,"Clearly , many occupations other than the ones listed in [ link ] involve at least a moderate amount of job strain in that they often involve heavy workloads and little job control ( e.g. , inability to decide when to take breaks ) .",0
5180,"Frequently , a person who is addicted to drugs and/or alcohol has an additional psychological disorder .",0
5181,Saying a person has comorbid disorders means the individual has two or more diagnoses .,1
5182,"This can often be a substance - related diagnosis and another psychiatric diagnosis , such as depression , bipolar disorder , or schizophrenia .",0
5183,Physical disorders or diseases whose symptoms are brought about or worsened by stress and emotional factors are called psychophysiological disorders .,1
5184,The physical symptoms of psychophysiological disorders are real and they can be produced or exacerbated by psychological factors ( hence the psycho and physiological in psychophysiological ) .,0
5185,"The question of whether stress and negative emotional states can influence immune function has captivated researchers for over three decades , and discoveries made over that time have dramatically changed the face of health psychology ( Kiecolt - Glaser , 2009 ) .",0
5186,Psychoneuroimmunology is the field that studies how psychological factors such as stress influence the immune system and immune functioning .,1
5187,"The term psychoneuroimmunology was first coined in 1981 , when it appeared as the title of a book that reviewed available evidence for associations between the brain , endocrine system , and immune system ( Zacharie , 2009 ) .",0
5188,The cardiovascular system is composed of the heart and blood circulation system .,1
5189,"For many years , disorders that involve the cardiovascular system — known as cardiovascular disorders — have been a major focal point in the study of psychophysiological disorders because of the cardiovascular system ’s centrality in the stress response ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .",1
5190,Heart disease is one such condition .,0
5191,"Also , one investigation followed over 1,000 male medical students from 32 to 48 years .",0
5192,"At the beginning of the study , these men completed a questionnaire assessing how they react to pressure ; some indicated that they respond with high levels of anger , whereas others indicated that they respond with less anger .",0
5193,"Decades later , researchers found that those who earlier had indicated the highest levels of anger were over 6 times more likely than those who indicated less anger to have had a heart attack by age 55 , and they were 3.5 times more likely to have experienced heart disease by the same age ( Chang , Ford , Meoni , Wang , & Klag , 2002 ) .",0
5194,"Asthma is a chronic and serious disease in which the airways of the respiratory system become obstructed , leading to great difficulty expelling air from the lungs .",1
5195,"The airway obstruction is caused by inflammation of the airways ( leading to thickening of the airway walls ) and a tightening of the muscles around them , resulting in a narrowing of the airways ( [ link ] ) ( American Lung Association , 2010 ) .",1
5196,"Family therapy is a special form of group therapy , consisting of one or more families .",1
5197,"Although there are many theoretical orientations in family therapy , one of the most predominant is the systems approach .",0
5198,"Both types of treatment help people with psychological disorders , such as depression , anxiety , and schizophrenia .",0
5199,"Psychotherapy is a psychological treatment that employs various methods to help someone overcome personal problems , or to attain personal growth .",1
5200,"In modern practice , it has evolved ino what is known as psychodynamic therapy , which will be discussed later .",0
5201,"In a psychoanalyst ’s office , you might see a patient lying on a couch speaking of dreams or childhood memories , and the therapist using various Freudian methods such as free association and dream analysis ( [ link ] ) .",0
5202,"In free association , the patient relaxes and then says whatever comes to mind at the moment .",1
5203,"However , Freud felt that the ego would at times try to block , or repress , unacceptable urges or painful conflicts during free association .",0
5204,"Today , Freud ’s psychoanalytical perspective has been expanded upon by the developments of subsequent theories and methodologies : the psychodynamic perspective .",0
5205,"This approach to therapy remains centered on the role of people ’s internal drives and forces , but treatment is less intensive than Freud ’s original model .",0
5206,"In psychoanalysis , therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings .",1
5207,"In behavior therapy , a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors — rather than digging deeply into one ’s unconscious .",1
5208,"Therapists with this orientation believe that dysfunctional behaviors , like phobias and bedwetting , can be changed by teaching clients new , more constructive behaviors .",0
5209,"In exposure therapy , a therapist seeks to treat clients’ fears or anxiety by presenting them with the object or situation that causes their problem , with the idea that they will eventually get used to it .",1
5210,"This can be done via reality , imagination , or virtual reality .",0
5211,One popular operant conditioning intervention is called the token economy .,0
5212,"This involves a controlled setting where individuals are reinforced for desirable behaviors with tokens , such as a poker chip , that can be exchanged for items or privileges .",1
5213,"PSYCHOTHERAPY : COGNITIVE - BEHAVIORAL THERAPYCognitive - behavioral therapists focus much more on present issues than on a patient ’s childhood or past , as in other forms of psychotherapy .",1
5214,"One of the first forms of cognitive - behavioral therapy was rational emotive therapy ( RET ) , which was founded by Albert Ellis and grew out of his dislike of Freudian psychoanalysis ( Daniel , n.d . ) .",1
5215,"Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis ’s therapeutic approach ( National Association of Cognitive - Behavioral Therapists , 2009).Cognitive - behavioral therapy ( CBT ) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior .",1
5216,"Psychologist Carl Rogers developed a therapeutic orientation known as Rogerian , or client - centered therapy .",0
5217,Note the change from patients to clients .,0
5218,"While these are often used in combination with psychotherapy , they also are taken by individuals not in therapy .",0
5219,This is known as biomedical therapy .,0
5220,"Medications used to treat psychological disorders are called psychotropic medications and are prescribed by medical doctors , including psychiatrists .",1
5221,"When we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful , it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress .",0
5222,"Coping refers to mental and behavioral efforts that we use to deal with problems relating to stress , including its presumed cause and the unpleasant feelings and emotions it produces .",1
5223,"As cogently described in his statement , our reaction to potential stressors depends to a large extent on how much control we feel we have over such things .",0
5224,"Perceived control is our beliefs about our personal capacity to exert influence over and shape outcomes , and it has major implications for our health and happiness ( Infurna & Gerstorf , 2014 ) .",1
5225,"Extensive research has demonstrated that perceptions of personal control are associated with a variety of favorable outcomes , such as better physical and mental health and greater psychological well - being ( Diehl & Hay , 2010 ) .",0
5226,"While having social support is quite beneficial , being the recipient of prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behaviors is associated with a number of negative outcomes .",0
5227,"In their literature review , Brondolo , Brady , Pencille , Beatty , and Contrada ( 2009 ) describe how racial prejudice and discrimination serve as unique , significant stressors for those who are the targets of such attitudes and behavior .",0
5228,"Being the target of racism is associated with increased rates of depression , lowered self - esteem , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease .",0
5229,"In the 1970s , Herbert Benson , a cardiologist , developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique ( Greenberg , 2006 ) .",0
5230,"The relaxation response technique combines relaxation with transcendental meditation , and consists of four components ( Stein , 2001 ) :",1
5231,"Although the study of stress and how it affects us physically and psychologically is fascinating , it is — admittedly — somewhat of a grim topic .",0
5232,Psychology is also interested in the study of a more upbeat and encouraging approach to human affairs — the quest for happiness .,0
5233,"In 1998 , Seligman ( the same person who conducted the learned helplessness experiments mentioned earlier ) , who was then president of the American Psychological Association , urged psychologists to focus more on understanding how to build human strength and psychological well - being .",0
5234,"In deliberately setting out to create a new direction and new orientation for psychology , Seligman helped establish a growing movement and field of research called positive psychology ( Compton , 2005 ) .",0
5235,"In terms of our health , the expression , “ do n’t worry , be happy ” is helpful advice indeed .",0
5236,There has also been much work suggesting that optimism — the general tendency to look on the bright side of things — is also a significant predictor of positive health outcomes .,1
5237,"In the late 1700s , a French physician , Philippe Pinel , argued for more humane treatment of the mentally ill .",0

5250,The aggregate supply ( AS ) curve shows the total quantity of output ( i.e .,1
5251,real GDP ) that firms will produce and sell at each price level .,1
5252,[ link ] shows an aggregate supply curve .,0
5253,Aggregate demand ( AD ) refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy .,1
5254,"( Strictly speaking , AD is what economists call total planned expenditure .",0
5255,"U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall .",0
5256,"U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper , so the quantity of imports will rise .",0
5257,"Thus , a higher domestic price level , relative to price levels in other countries , will reduce net export expenditures .",0
5258,"In the long run , the most important factor shifting the AS curve is productivity growth .",0
5259,Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor .,1
5260,"When consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy , they tend to consume more .",1
5261,"If business confidence is high , then firms tend to spend more on investment , believing that the future payoff from that investment will be substantial .",0
5262,"Conversely , if consumer or business confidence drops , then consumption and investment spending decline .",0
5263,"During a recession , when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses , the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts .",0
5264,"During the recession of 2001 , for example , a tax cut was enacted into law .",0
5265,"In many of the national economies across Europe , the rate of unemployment in recent decades has only dropped to about 10 % or a bit lower , even in good economic years .",0
5266,This baseline level of unemployment that occurs year - in and year - out is called the natural rate of unemployment and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market .,1
5267,"Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates in different economies , depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy .",1
5268,"Now , focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve , which is the near - vertical portion on the right - hand side .",0
5269,"If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or near potential GDP , then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in the economy .",0
5270,"Because AD is volatile , it can easily fall .",0
5271,"Thus , even if we start at Yp , if AD falls , then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a recessionary gap .",0
5272,"The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at Y1 in the [ link ] .",0
5273,"Nondurable goods are things like groceries — once you consume them , they are gone .",1
5274,"Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy , like healthcare or entertainment . Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption :",0
5275,"Just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes , so businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items .",0
5276,The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate .,0
5277,"Even if the firm has the funds , the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital .",1
5278,"First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment .",0
5279,"Second , the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices , which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand .",1
5280,"We will consider these two claims in turn , and then see how they are represented in the AD / AS model . The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of household and business sector demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed .",1
5281,"In fact , if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all , the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .",0
5282,"This outcome is an important example of a macroeconomic externality , where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level .",1
5283,"For example , a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales .",0
5284,"In the 1950s , A.W .",0
5285,"Phillips , an economist at the London School of Economics , was studying the Keynesian analytical framework .",0
5286,The second is changes in people ’s expectations about inflation .,0
5287,"In other words , there may be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people expect no inflation , but when they realize inflation is occurring , the tradeoff disappears .",0
5288,"Both factors ( supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations ) cause the aggregate supply curve , and thus the Phillips curve , to shift .",0
5289,"In this situation , unemployment is low , but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern .",0
5290,"The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy , using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left .",0
5291,"The result would be downward pressure on the price level , but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment .",0
5292,The key policy implication is this : Should the government focus more on long - term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment ?,0
5293,This focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run .,0
5294,"Let 's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run",0
5295,Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology .,0
5296,Physical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done .,1
5297,"Compare , for example , your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software .",0
5298,"Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long time , then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical .",0
5299,"In response to those immortal words of John Maynard Keynes , “ In the long run we are all dead , ” neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as , say , ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy .",0
5300,"Since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time , the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy would be to speed up the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work .",1
5301,"Is that the likely outcome?Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the ability of the government to recognize a situation of too little or too much aggregate demand , and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending , all enacted in a timely fashion .",1
5302,"After all , neoclassical economists argue , it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring — and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later .",0
5303,"The macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels , and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation .",0
5304,The great economist Milton Friedman ( 1912–2006 ) summed up the neoclassical view of the long - term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech : “ [ T]here is always a temporary trade - off between inflation and unemployment ; there is no permanent trade - off . ”,0
5305,"If aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model , in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures .",0
5306,"[ link ] shows a vertical LRAS curve and three different levels of aggregate demand , rising from AD0 to AD1 to AD2 .",0
5307,"Instead , many mainstream economists believe both the Keynesian and neoclassical perspectives .",0
5308,"Robert Solow , the Nobel laureate in economics in 1987 , described the dual approach in this way :",0
5309,Economies without money typically engage in the barter system .,0
5310,Barter — literally trading one good or service for another — is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy .,1
5311,"In an economy without money , an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants , a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide .",1
5312,"Second , money must serve as a store of value .",0
5313,"In a barter system , we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services .",0
5314,Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future .,1
5315,"So money serves all of these functions— it is a medium of exchange , store of value , unit of account , and standard of deferred payment .",1
5316,"As economies grew and became more global in nature , the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome .",0
5317,Countries moved towards the use of fiat money .,0
5318,"Fiat money has no intrinsic value , but is declared by a government to be the legal tender of a country .",1
5319,There are two definitions of money : M1 and M2 money supply .,0
5320,"M1 money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash , checkable ( demand ) deposits , and traveler ’s checks M2 money supply is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , and money market funds . M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation — the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury , at the Federal Reserve Bank , or in bank vaults .",1
5321,"Closely related to currency are checkable deposits , also known as demand deposits .",0
5322,"For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank .",1
5323,"Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .",1
5324,"Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ 100,000 ) certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , ranging from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate .",1
5325,"It is important to note that in our definition of money , it ischeckable deposits that are money , not the paper check or the debit card .",0
5326,"Although you can make a purchase with a credit card , it is not considered money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you .",0
5327,"When you make a purchase with a credit card , the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller , and at the end of the month , the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month .",0
5328,"Banks are a critical intermediary in what is called the payment system , which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets .",1
5329,"Also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date .",0
5330,"Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .",1
5331,"Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans .",1
5332,"All the funds deposited are mingled in one big pool , which is then loaned out .",0
5333,A Bank ’s Balance SheetA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities .,1
5334,An asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something .,1
5335,"For example , the cash you own can be used to pay your tuition .",0
5336,A bank ’s balance sheet operates in much the same way .,0
5337,A bank ’s net worth is also referred to as bank capital .,1
5338,"A bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults , monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve bank ( called “ reserves ” ) , loans that are made to customers , and bonds .",1
5339,"The second category of bank asset is bonds , which are a common mechanism for borrowing , used by the federal and local government , and also private companies , and nonprofit organizations .",1
5340,A bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds — typically bonds issued by the U.S. government .,0
5341,"The bank will be more willing to make what are called “ subprime loans , ” which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down - payment , little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income , and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments after that .",1
5342,"Some subprime loans made in the mid-2000s were later dubbed NINJA loans : loans made even though the borrower had demonstrated No Income , No Job , or Assets . These subprime loans were typically sold and turned into financial securities — but with a twist .",0
5343,"The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage - backed securities , certain investors would agree to take the first , say , 5 % of such losses .",0
5344,"Fortunately , a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system .",0
5345,The money multiplier formula is :,0
5346,"Some prominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank , the Bank of Japan , and the Bank of England .",0
5347,"In the United States , the central bank is called the Federal Reserve — often abbreviated as just “ the Fed . ” This section explains the organization of the U.S. Federal Reserve and identifies the major responsibilities of a central bank .",1
5348,Bank regulation is intended to maintain the solvency of banks by avoiding excessive risk .,1
5349,"Regulation falls into a number of categories , including reserve requirements , capital requirements , and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make .",0
5350,"They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but , to protect depositors , they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky . Bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its liabilities .",1
5351,"In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth .",0
5352,"A bank must have positive net worth ; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt , meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities .",0
5353,"In this situation , whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money , and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough , lost their money .",0
5354,"Depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits , as shown in [ link ] is called a bank run .",1
5355,"In the movie It ’s a Wonderful Life , the bank manager , played by Jimmy Stewart , faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money , but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits — using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon .",0
5356,"To prevent this , the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they can not obtain funds from anywhere else .",1
5357,This is known as the lender of last resort role .,0
5358,"For banks , the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money .",0
5359,The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) makes the decisions regarding these open market operations .,1
5360,The FOMC is made up of the seven members of the Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors .,0
5361,"A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank .",1
5362,"If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to lend out .",0
5363,"If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves , they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out .",0
5364,A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy .,1
5365,"Conversely , a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy .",1
5366,"This module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand , and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation .",0
5367,"If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment , with output below potential GDP , expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP .",0
5368,[ link ] ( a ) illustrates this situation .,0
5369,[ link ] shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades .,0
5370,"The graph shows the federal funds interest rate ( remember , this interest rate is set through open market operations ) , the unemployment rate , and the inflation rate since 1975 .",0
5371,Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure .,0
5372,Quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways .,0
5373,"First , it involved the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds , rather than short term Treasury bills .",1
5374,"In 2008 , however , it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get .",0
5375,"If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level , the central bank can not force individual banks to make loans .",0
5376,"Similarly , sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession , because they recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in a recession , and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments .",0
5377,"The result is that during an especially deep recession , an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP .",0
5378,Specific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply being used .,0
5379,"Consider the velocity of M1 , the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances .",0
5380,"In 2009 , for example , M1 was $ 1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $ 14.3 trillion , so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 ( $ 14.3 trillion/$1.7 trillion ) .",0
5381,"This equation is sometimes called the basic quantity equation of money but , as you can see , it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form .",0
5382,"This equation must hold true , by definition .",0
5383,"In the 1970s , when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable , a number of economists , led by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman ( 1912–2006 ) , argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate .",0
5384,"These economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy , and the political pressures on central bankers , central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects .",0
5385,"This vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice inflation targeting , which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low .",1
5386,"By 2014 , central banks in 28 countries , including Austria , Brazil , Canada , Israel , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , Thailand , and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate .",0
5387,One long - standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future .,0
5388,"For example , from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “ dot - com ” boom , the U.S. stock market , which is measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Index ( which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy ) , nearly tripled in value .",1
5389,"The Nasdaq index , which includes many smaller technology companies , increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000 .",0
5390,"At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow .",1
5391,"Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made .",1
5392,"In good economic times , this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth .",0
5393,Sometimes small economies use the currency of an economically larger neighbor .,0
5394,"For example , Ecuador , El Salvador , and Panama have decided to dollarize — that is , to use the U.S. dollar as their currency .",1
5395,Sometimes nations share a common currency .,0
5396,"In foreign exchange markets , demand and supply become closely interrelated , because a person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency — and vice versa .",0
5397,"To get a sense of this , it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market : ( 1 ) firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services ; ( 2 ) tourists visiting other countries ; ( 3 ) international investors buying ownership ( or part - ownership ) of a foreign firm ; ( 4 ) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership .",0
5398,Let ’s consider these categories in turn .,0
5399,"Let ’s say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth , and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently is .",0
5400,"You can hedge , which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your investments ( in this case , currency risk from the contract ) .",1
5401,"Specifically , you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now — regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time .",0
5402,"When the prices of most goods and services change , the price is said to “ rise ” or “ fall . ” For exchange rates , the terminology is different .",0
5403,"When the exchange rate for a currency rises , so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies , it is referred to as appreciating or “ strengthening . ” When the exchange rate for a currency falls , so that a currency trades for less of other currencies , it is referred to as depreciating or “ weakening.”To illustrate the use of these terms , consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980 , shown in [ link ] ( a ) .",1
5404,"The vertical axis in [ link ] ( a ) shows the price of $ 1 in U.S. currency , measured in terms of Canadian currency .",0
5405,"In the actual foreign exchange market , almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is done for U.S. dollars .",0
5406,"What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift , thus leading to a change in the equilibrium exchange rate ?",0
5407,The answer to this question is discussed in the following section .,0
5408,"The exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the purchasing power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate . A group of economists at the International Comparison Program , run by the World Bank , have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries , based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods .",1
5409,Foreign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while receiving revenues from sales in another currency .,0
5410,"As a result , movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import , and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole .",0
5411,Banks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers .,0
5412,"When most of a country ’s largest banks become bankrupt simultaneously , a sharp decline in aggregate demand and a deep recession results .",0
5413,"Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable , a central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country ’s existing banks into bankruptcy .",0
5414,"In 2013 , there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen ( relative to the U.S. Dollar ) by about 14 % and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14 % .",0
5415,( Source : Federal Reserve Economic Data ( FRED ) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS ) The line 's variations represent the volatility of exchange rates .,0
5416,"A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market .",1
5417,"With a hard peg exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate .",1
5418,A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies .,0
5419,"Brazil ’s central bank can use a contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates , which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets , and lead to an appreciation .",0
5420,"Alternatively , Brazil ’s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market .",0
5421,Another issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market .,0
5422,"If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like U.S. dollars or euros , to hold as reserves .",0
5423,"Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost , and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit .",0
5424,"Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes , named after James Tobin , the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture .",1
5425,"For example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term portfolio investment while exempting long - term foreign direct investment .",0
5426,A final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a merged currency .,1
5427,A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether .,0
5428,"In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !",0
5429,Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) .,0
5430,"While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand .",1
5431,"All government spending and taxes affect the economy , but fiscal policy focuses strictly on the policies of the federal government .",0
5432,"Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .",1
5433,"If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget .",1
5434,"For example , in 2009 , the U.S. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever , as the federal government spent $ 1.4 trillion more than it collected in taxes .",0
5435,"Together , the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80 % of federal tax revenues in 2014 .",0
5436,"Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax , nearly three - quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes . The income tax is a progressive tax , which means that the tax rates increase as a household ’s income increases .",1
5437,"Taxes also vary with marital status , family size , and other factors .",0
5438,"The Medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned .",1
5439,"The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax .",1
5440,"As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .",0
5441,The government also imposes an estate and gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation — either after death or during life in the form of gifts .,0
5442,These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2 % of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s .,0
5443,"Graphically , we see that fiscal policy , whether through change in spending or taxes , shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy .",1
5444,[ link ] illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand / aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy .,0
5445,The stimulus package of 2009 is an example .,0
5446,"Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically , due to automatic stabilizers , such as unemployment insurance and food stamps , which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom .",1
5447,"Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets , it not only affects aggregate demand — it can also affect interest rates .",0
5448,"In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $ 800 billion and an interest rate of 6 % .",1
5449,Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time .,0
5450,The time to get a bill passed is often referred to as the legislative lag .,1
5451,"Finally , once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs .",0
5452,"Also , the government is not a household for many reasons , one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities .",0
5453,"The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind , spending when times are hard and saving when times are good , for the sake of the overall economy .",1
5454,"The national saving and investment identity must always hold true because , by definition , the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal .",0
5455,"However , the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit .",0
5456,"For example , in 1999 and 2000 , the U.S. government had budget surpluses , although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits .",0
5457,How will this affect interest rates in financial markets ?,0
5458,"In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) where the demand curve ( D0 ) for financial capital intersects with the supply curve ( S0 ) occurs at an interest rate of 5 % and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20 % of GDP .",0
5459,"However , as the government budget deficit increases , the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D0 to D1 .",0
5460,"If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy .",0
5461,"In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment . On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy .",0
5462,"In this situation , higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy , and there would be little crowding out of private investment . However , even a central bank can not erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity .",0
5463,The theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as Ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth - century economist David Ricardo ( 1772–1823 ) .,1
5464,"If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true , then in the national saving and investment identity , any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving .",0
5465,"First , banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros , then convert those U.S. dollars to lira , and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey .",0
5466,"If the value of the lira exchange rate depreciates , then Turkey ’s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros . The combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand , which causes a deep recession .",0
5467,"Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years : along with Turkey in 2002 , this general pattern was followed by Mexico in 1995 , Thailand and countries across East Asia in 1997–1998 , Russia in 1998 , and Argentina in 2002 .",0
5468,"For example , life expectancy at birth in many low - income regions approximates those who are more affluent .",0
5469,The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect standards of living .,0
5470,"For instance , despite very high income levels , there is still undernourishment in Europe and North America .",0
5471,"The world ’s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of nations sometimes known as the East Asian Tigers : South Korea , Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Singapore .",1
5472,"The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan , although these are often treated under international law as part of China , rather than as separate countries .",0
5473,"For unemployment caused by a recession , the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available .",0
5474,"The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .",0
5475,"In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates . With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .",0
5476,"There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases .",0
5477,"In the case of the Great Recession , the case for this kind of extra - aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger , but for a smaller recession , given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy , discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution . However , the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp .",0
5478,"Likewise , interest rates that are not indexed mean that the lenders of money will be paid back in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that were lent .",0
5479,It is clearly possible — and perhaps sometimes necessary — for a converging economy ( the economy of a country that demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders ) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be politically unacceptable in the high - income economies .,1
5480,Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that a trade deficit exists when a nation ’s imports exceed its exports .,0
5481,"In order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) .",0
5482,"It would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy , shifting the short - term aggregate supply curve to the left .",0
5483,"The result could be a burst of inflation and , if the Federal Reserve were to run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation , it could also lead to recession .",0
5484,"People sometimes talk as if the U.S. economy , with its great size , is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets .",0
5485,World War I severed many economic connections .,0
5486,"During the Great Depression of the 1930s , many nations misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others .",0
5487,World War II further hindered international trade .,0
5488,Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods .,0
5489,The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this : “ What do we give up to produce this good ? ” It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity .,0
5490,The United States produces / consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn .,0
5491,"Given their current production levels , if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels , it will gain from trade .",0
5492,"With trade , the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade .",0
5493,"Then , in the numerical example given , Mexico shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators .",0
5494,"Thus , if Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes ( giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes ) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500 refrigerators ( a gain of 2,500 refrigerators ) , it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade .",0
5495,Mexico will be unambiguously better off .,0
5496,"What can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars , computers , machinery and other products which are then shipped across the oceans to and from the United States , the European Union , and Japan ?",0
5497,"There are two reasons : ( 1 ) The division of labor leads to learning , innovation , and unique skills ; and ( 2 ) economies of scale .",0
5498,A second broad reason that intra - industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale .,0
5499,"The concept of economies of scale , as introduced in Cost and Industry Structure , means that as the scale of output goes up , average costs of production decline — at least up to a point .",1
5500,[ link ] illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens .,0
5501,Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons .,1
5502,"Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries , for humanitarian reasons , and protecting against dumping .",0
5503,"Traditionally , tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic , social , and cultural interests .",0
5504,Recall from International Trade that tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services .,0
5505,"They make imports more expensive for consumers , discouraging imports .",0
5506,( We ’ll cover the GATT in more detail later in the chapter . ),0
5507,"This agreement has since been superseded by the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the economies of the world .",0
5508,"It is the primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules — including rules about tariffs , quotas , and nontariff barriers .",1
5509,"There are a number of reasons , but one of them will surprise you : the trade policies of the high - income countries .",0
5510,"Profits , in turn , are also determined by the price of the outputs the firm sells and by the price of the inputs , like labor or raw materials , the firm needs to buy .",0
5511,Aggregate supply ( AS ) refers to the total quantity of output ( i.e .,1
5512,real GDP ) firms will produce and sell .,1
5513,"When an economy is operating at its potential GDP , machines and factories are running at capacity , and the unemployment rate is relatively low — at the natural rate of unemployment .",0
5514,"For this reason , potential GDP is sometimes also called full - employment GDP .",0
5515,"The foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other countries , then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world .",0
5516,"U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall .",0
5517,"U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper , so the quantity of imports will rise .",0
5518,"For this reason , what we have been calling the AS curve , will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply ( SRAS ) curve .",0
5519,The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply ( LRAS ) curve .,0
5520,"For example , the U.S. economy experienced recessions in 1974–1975 , 1980–1982 , 1990–91 , 2001 , and 2007–2009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices .",0
5521,"In the 1970s , this pattern of a shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation . Conversely , a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right , providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs .",0
5522,"From 1985 to 1986 , for example , the average price of crude oil fell by almost half , from $ 24 a barrel to $ 12 a barrel .",0
5523,"If changes of a few percentage points of GDP seem small to you , remember that since GDP was about $ 14.4 trillion in 2009 , a seemingly small change of 2 % of GDP is equal to close to $ 300 billion . Tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending , too .",0
5524,"Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand , while tax increases will tend to diminish it .",0
5525,Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment .,0
5526,Two types of unemployment were described in the Unemployment chapter .,0
5527,Cyclical unemployment bounces up and down according to the short - run movements of GDP .,1
5528,"Over the long run , in the United States , the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5 % ( give or take one percentage point or so ) , when the economy is healthy .",0
5529,"Focus first on the Keynesian zone , that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat .",1
5530,"If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek , then certain statements about the economic situation will follow .",0
5531,The idea is simple : firms produce output only if they expect it to sell .,0
5532,"Thus , while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation ’s potential GDP , the amount of goods and services actually being sold , known as real GDP , depends on how much demand exists across the economy .",1
5533,"This point is illustrated in [ link].The Keynesian AD / AS ModelThe Keynesian View of the AD / AS Model uses an SRAS curve , which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output .",0
5534,"As a consequence , the economy experiences inflation .",0
5535,"The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap , increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output . Recall from The Aggregate Supply - Aggregate Demand Model that aggregate demand is total spending , economy - wide , on domestic goods and services .",1
5536,( Aggregate demand ( AD ) is actually what economists call total planned expenditure .,0
5537,Spending on new capital goods is called investment expenditure .,1
5538,"Investment falls into four categories : producer ’s durable equipment and software , new nonresidential structures ( such as factories , offices , and retail locations ) , changes in inventories , and residential structures ( such as single - family homes , townhouses , and apartment buildings ) .",0
5539,) Keynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription for minimizing their effects .,1
5540,The Keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks .,0
5541,"First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment .",0
5542,"Second , frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry — especially if they find out that a product now costs more than expected .",1
5543,These costs of changing prices are called menu costs — like the costs of printing up a new set of menus with different prices in a restaurant .,0
5544,"Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand , but from a macroeconomic perspective , the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time .",0
5545,"Thus , when investment spending collapsed during the Great Depression , it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP .",0
5546,"The size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in recent discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration ’s fiscal stimulus package , officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 .",0
5547,Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation .,0
5548,This pattern became known as stagflation .,0
5549,( Recall from The Aggregate Demand / Aggregate Supply Model that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation . ),1
5550,"He proposed that the government could bury money underground , and let mining companies get started to dig the money up again .",0
5551,"These suggestions were slightly tongue - in - cheek , but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to potential GDP .",0
5552,"The neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that , in the long run , the economy will fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment .",0
5553,"This chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics : ( 1 ) the size of the economy is determined by potential GDP , and ( 2 ) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output .",0
5554,Actual or real GDP is benchmarked against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is performing .,0
5555,Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology .,0
5556,"Neoclassical economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long - run aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP — that is , the long - run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line drawn at the level of potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] .",0
5557,"A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of aggregate supply ( or potential GDP ) will determine the real GDP of the economy , regardless of the level of aggregate demand .",0
5558,"Over time , increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital , increases in human capital , and technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right .",0
5559,"After all , many people and firms are not especially well informed , either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works .",0
5560,"An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations : they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change , but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory .",1
5561,"If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations , then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time . The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear - cut .",0
5562,The Keynesian Perspective introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve .,0
5563,"The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve ; thus , there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run .",0
5564,"Neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment ; after all , if economic output is determined by a vertical aggregate supply curve , then aggregate demand has no long - run effect on unemployment .",0
5565,"Instead , neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right — keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low .",0
5566,"However , the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years .",0
5567,"Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long - lasting recession , like the Great Depression of the 1930s .",0
5568,Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment ; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment .,0
5569,"At this point , you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics !",0
5570,": economic growth , low unemployment , and low inflation .",0
5571,We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals . You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( AD / AS ) model .,0
5572,"With the goals and frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind , the final step is to discuss the two main categories of macroeconomic policy : monetary policy , which focuses on money , banking and interest rates ; and fiscal policy , which focuses on government spending , taxes , and borrowing .",1
5573,( We will get to its definition soon . ),0
5574,"First , money serves as a medium of exchange , which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller .",0
5575,"Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes , the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money .",0
5576,"Finally , another function of money is that money must serve as a standard of deferred payment .",0
5577,"This means that if money is usable today to make purchases , it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future .",1
5578,"Of course , gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in the creation of jewelry . As commodity money , gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange , a store of value , and as a unit of account .",0
5579,Commodity - backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodity held at a bank .,1
5580,"During much of its history , the money supply in the United States was backed by gold and silver .",0
5581,"less liquid . The Federal Reserve Bank , which is the central bank of the United States , is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity .",1
5582,There are two definitions of money : M1 and M2 money supply .,0
5583,"A broader definition of money , M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits .",0
5584,"For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank .",1
5585,"Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds .",0
5586,"Where does “ plastic money ” like debit cards , credit cards , and smart money fit into this picture ?",0
5587,"A debit card , like a check , is an instruction to the user ’s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller .",1
5588,"It is important to note that in our definition of money , it ischeckable deposits that are money , not the paper check or the debit card .",0
5589,"One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins ; instead , money is closely linked to bank accounts .",0
5590,"Indeed , the macroeconomic policies concerning money are largely conducted through the banking system .",0
5591,The next section explains how banks function and how a nation ’s banking system has the power to create money .,0
5592,Banks as Financial IntermediariesAn “ intermediary ” is one who stands between two other parties .,1
5593,"Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank .",1
5594,"Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans .",0
5595,A Bank ’s Balance SheetA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities .,1
5596,An asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something .,1
5597,"In this case , a home is the asset , but the mortgage is the liability .",0
5598,The net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed ( the liability ) . A bank ’s balance sheet operates in much the same way .,1
5599,"Many banks issue home loans , and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so , but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments .",0
5600,"The market where loans are made to borrowers is called the primary loan market , while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market . One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan , when they buy it in the secondary loan market , is the perceived riskiness of the loan : that is , given the characteristics of the borrower , such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly , what proportion of loans of this type will be repaid ?",1
5601,"The greater the risk that a loan will not be repaid , the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan .",0
5602,Securitization offers certain advantages .,0
5603,"If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area , then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines , so that many people are unable to make their payments .",0
5604,"Clearly , the bank can not survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers . How can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an asset - liability time mismatch ?",0
5605,"One strategy is for a bank to diversify its loans , which means lending to a variety of customers .",1
5606,"For example , suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market — say , making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area .",0
5607,The organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation ’s financial system operates smoothly is called the central bank .,1
5608,Most nations have central banks or currency boards .,0
5609,A safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve .,0
5610,"The goal is not only to protect individuals’ savings , but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself .",0
5611,"Banks are allowed to make loans to businesses , individuals , and other banks .",0
5612,"They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but , to protect depositors , they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky . Bank capital is the difference between a bank ’s assets and its liabilities .",1
5613,"In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth .",0
5614,The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank ’s assets is not always straightforward .,0
5615,"As discussed in Money and Banking , a bank ’s assets are its loans , and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that these loans will not be repaid .",1
5616,"These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries , or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan . The political question arises because the decision by a bank supervisor to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial , and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off .",0
5617,"About 70 countries around the world , including all of the major economies , have deposit insurance programs .",0
5618,"In the United States , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) is responsible for deposit insurance .",1
5619,Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC .,0
5620,The most commonly used tool of monetary policy in the U.S. is open market operations .,0
5621,Open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates .,1
5622,"A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank .",1
5623,"If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves , they have less money available to lend out .",0
5624,A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy .,1
5625,"Conversely , a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy .",1
5626,"Of course , financial markets display a wide range of interest rates , representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that are to be repaid over different periods of time .",0
5627,"In general , when the federal funds rate drops substantially , other interest rates drop , too , and when the federal funds rate rises , other interest rates rise .",0
5628,"In [ link ] ( b ) , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) occurs at an output of 750 , which is above potential GDP .",0
5629,"A contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates , discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending , and cause the original demand curve ( AD0 ) to shift left to AD1 , so that the new equilibrium ( E1 ) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.These examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical ; that is , it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings .",1
5630,Monetary policy should be loosened when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tightened when inflation threatens .,0
5631,"With the recession still ongoing , the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing ( QE ) .",0
5632,This is the purchase of long - term government and private mortgage - backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand .,1
5633,"Banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves , but no rule prohibits them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit .",0
5634,"For example , during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend , because they fear that when the economy is contracting , a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans .",0
5635,Unpredictable Movements of VelocityVelocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy .,1
5636,The velocity of money in a year is defined as :,0
5637,Remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation .,1
5638,"If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and the rate of inflation is 3 % , then the borrower is effectively paying a 4 % real interest rate .",0
5639,"If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and there is deflation of 2 % , then the real interest rate is actually 9 % .",0
5640,"So far at least , it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up - and - down fluctuations in M1 .",0
5641,"Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking , M2 is now favored as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1 .",0
5642,"In the neoclassical model , the level of potential GDP ( and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP ) is determined by real economic factors .",0
5643,"If the original level of aggregate demand is AD0 , then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD1 only creates an inflationary increase in the price level , but it does not alter GDP or unemployment .",0
5644,"From this perspective , all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation — and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy .",0
5645,"Instead , the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account . Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion .",0
5646,"For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy , the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy — even if the economy is already producing at potential GDP .",0
5647,"In some countries , the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures , with the result of higher inflation , but no long - term reduction in unemployment .",0
5648,"At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow .",1
5649,"Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made .",1
5650,"This chapter discusses the international dimension of money , which involves conversions from one currency to another at an exchange rate .",0
5651,"An exchange rate is nothing more than a price — that is , the price of one currency in terms of another currency — and so they can be analyzed with the tools of supply and demand .",1
5652,"The first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets : their size , their main participants , and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates .",0
5653,You have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters .,0
5654,"In The International Trade and Capital Flows , for example , we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare GDP statistics from countries where GDP is measured in different currencies .",0
5655,"These earlier examples , however , took the actual exchange rate as given , as if it were a fact of nature .",0
5656,"The other kind of international financial investment , portfolio investment , involves a purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility .",1
5657,"An example would be a U.S. financial investor who purchased bonds issued by the government of the United Kingdom , or deposited money in a British bank .",0
5658,"These banks ( and a few other firms ) , known as dealers , then trade the foreign exchange .",0
5659,This is called the interbank market .,0
5660,The horizontal axis shows the quantity of Mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market .,0
5661,"The demand curve ( D ) for Mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve ( S ) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point ( E ) , which is an exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos .",0
5662,Note that the two exchange rates are inverses : 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso ( or $ 0.10 per peso ) .,0
5663,"If the price of cars was much higher than $ 32,000 in this example , then at least some Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars .",0
5664,"This is known as arbitrage , the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit .",1
5665,"It may occur slowly , but over time , it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries .",0
5666,"A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons : ( 1 ) Movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy ; ( 2 ) frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation ’s banking system – this may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital , which can set the economy up for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country .",0
5667,"Let ’s discuss these scenarios in turn . Exchange Rates , Aggregate Demand , and Aggregate Supply",0
5668,"In 1997–1998 , countries across eastern Asia , like Thailand , Korea , Malaysia , and Indonesia , experienced a sharp depreciation of their currencies , in some cases 50 % or more .",0
5669,"These countries had been experiencing substantial inflows of foreign investment capital , with bank lending increasing by 20 % to 30 % per year through the mid-1990s .",0
5670,"When their exchange rates depreciated , the banking systems in these countries were bankrupt .",0
5671,A policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates is referred to as a floating exchange rate .,1
5672,"The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate , as are the currencies of about 40 % of the countries in the world economy .",0
5673,"When a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced , it is said to have established a “ peg ” for its currency .",1
5674,"A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market .",1
5675,"With a hard peg exchange rate policy , the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate .",1
5676,"The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals , use the reals to purchase foreign currencies , and avoid selling any of its own currency .",0
5677,"In this way , it can fill the gap between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its currency .",0
5678,"For example , when a country pegs its exchange rate , it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession — but it can not do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg .",0
5679,"With a soft peg exchange rate policy , the central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession — but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate .",0
5680,"With a hard peg policy , domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment , but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg .",0
5681,"Thus , even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short - term fluctuations of the exchange rate , the existence of the policy — when anticipated in the foreign exchange market — may sometimes increase short - term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act .",0
5682,The following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects of international capital flows — capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or direct investment .,0
5683,But proposals to limit international financial flows have severe practical difficulties .,0
5684,"Taxes are imposed by national governments , not international ones .",0
5685,"In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !",0
5686,Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) .,0
5687,"While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand .",0
5688,"When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year , it runs a budget deficit .",1
5689,"Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus .",1
5690,"If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget .",1
5691,"When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government , the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 ( or the first business day after ) .",0
5692,"The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue , but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue . The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax ( captured in social insurance and retirement receipts ) , which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare .",0
5693,Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time .,0
5694,"The Medicare payroll tax is also called a proportional tax ; that is , a flat percentage of all wages earned .",1
5695,"The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax .",1
5696,"The federal government has a few other , smaller sources of revenue .",0
5697,"It imposes an excise tax — that is , a tax on a particular good — on gasoline , tobacco , and alcohol .",1
5698,"As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .",0
5699,Another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual deficits .,0
5700,"The national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time ; in contrast , the budget deficit refers to how much has been borrowed in one particular year .",1
5701,[ link ] shows the ratio of debt / GDP since 1940 .,0
5702,The millions of unemployed in 2008–2009 could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their salaries .,0
5703,"Federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy , when the government passes a new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels .",1
5704,The stimulus package of 2009 is an example .,0
5705,"In the early 1960s , many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle , and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation , were a thing of the past .",0
5706,"On the cover of its December 31 , 1965 , issue , Time magazine , then the premier news magazine in the United States , ran a picture of John Maynard Keynes , and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as “ the prime influence on the world ’s economies . ” The article reported that policymakers have “ used Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [ business ] cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices.”This happy consensus , however , did not last .",0
5707,"The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970 , a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975 , and then double - dip recessions from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982 .",0
5708,"It often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started , and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one- or two - month blip .",0
5709,The time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred is often called the recognition lag .,1
5710,"After this lag , policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills .",0
5711,Most economists view the proposals for a perpetually balanced budget with bemusement .,0
5712,"After all , in the short term , economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers .",0
5713,"The national saving and investment identity , first introduced in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter , provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets .",0
5714,The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true : the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded . The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital : private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public savings . Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G)Total savings = Private savings ( S ) + Public savings ( T – G)These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad .,1
5715,"If private saving and the trade balance remain the same , then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital .",0
5716,"When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital , the result is known as crowding out . To understand the potential impact of crowding out , consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007 .",1
5717,"In 2005 , for example , the budget deficit was roughly 4 % of GDP .",0
5718,"Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits , causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment .",0
5719,"If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy .",0
5720,"In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment . On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy .",0
5721,Not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government : many college students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education .,0
5722,"If low - income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade - school children , government spending seems likely to play a substantial role .",0
5723,Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits .,0
5724,"[ link ] shows a situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar , measured in euros .",0
5725,"At the original equilibrium ( E0 ) , where the demand for U.S. dollars ( D0 ) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars ( S0 ) on the foreign exchange market , the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $ 100 billion per day ( which was roughly the quantity of dollar – euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s ) .",0
5726,You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations .,0
5727,"As explained in The Macroeconomic Perspective , we must consider using purchasing power parity or “ international dollars ” to convert average incomes into comparable units .",0
5728,"Purchasing power parity , as formally defined in Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows , takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries . The Macroeconomic Perspective explained how to measure GDP , the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living , and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution .",0
5729,Where does economic growth come from ?,0
5730,"According to most economists who believe in the growth consensus , economic growth ( as discussed in Economic Growth ) is built on a foundation of productivity improvements .",0
5731,"In turn , productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology , all interacting in a market - driven economy .",0
5732,Lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in physical and human capital .,0
5733,"Recent research by two MIT economists , Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo , has confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they can not muster enough investment to push themselves out of poverty . For example , the average citizen of Burundi , the lowest - income country , subsists on $ 150 per year ( adjusted to 2005 dollars ) .",0
5734,"According to data collected by the Central Intelligence Agency in its CIA Factbook , as of 2013 , 90 % of Burundi ’s population is agrarian , with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop .",0
5735,"The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand .",0
5736,"In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates . With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession .",0
5737,"There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases .",0
5738,Policymakers of the high - income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting inflation .,0
5739,"First , whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run , monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term .",0
5740,"There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services : fear of job loss , environmental dangers , unfair labor practices , and many other concerns .",0
5741,"These arguments are discussed at some length in The International Trade and Capital Flows . Of all of the arguments for limitations on trade , perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the infant industry argument ; that is , subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established .",1
5742,( Globalization and Protectionism explains this concept in more detail . ),0
5743,"Instead of offering net financial investment abroad , the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all over the world .",0
5744,These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according to Sebastian Edwards writing for the National Bureau of Economic Research .,0
5745,"While trade deficits on their own are not bad , the question is whether they will be reduced gradually or hastily .",0
5746,The first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I .,0
5747,"Over that time , global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1 % of GDP in 1820 to 9 % of GDP in 1913 .",0
5748,A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good over another country if it uses fewer resources to produce that good .,1
5749,Absolute advantage can be the result of a country ’s natural endowment .,0
5750,"To simplify , let ’s say that Saudi Arabia and the United States each have 100 worker hours ( see [ link ] ) .",0
5751,"We illustrate what each country is capable of producing on its own using a production possibility frontier ( PPF ) graph , shown in [ link ] .",0
5752,"Recall from Choice in a World of Scarcity that the production possibilities frontier shows the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources , in this case workers , and its level of technology .",0
5753,Absolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between countries .,0
5754,"It answers the question , “ How many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico ? ” Comparative advantage asks this same question slightly differently .",0
5755,"Moreover , the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should specialize to a degree in certain products , and then exchange those products .",1
5756,"A high proportion of trade , however , is intra - industry trade — that is , trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another .",1
5757,"For example , the United States produces and exports autos and imports autos .",0
5758,"In fact , recent years have seen a trend in international trade called splitting up the value chain .",0
5759,The value chain describes how a good is produced in stages .,0
5760,"As indicated in the beginning of the chapter , the production of the iPhone involves the design and engineering of the phone in the United States , parts supplied from Korea , the assembly of the parts in China , and the advertising and marketing done in the United States .",0
5761,Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons .,1
5762,"Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries , for humanitarian reasons , and protecting against dumping .",0
5763,When a government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging in protectionism .,1
5764,Protectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition .,0
5765,"Nontariff barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules , regulations , inspections , and paperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products .",1
5766,"A rule requiring certain safety standards can limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas , for instance .",0
5767,"The extra 15 tons of sugar production , shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply curve in Brazil , is exported to the United States .",0
5768,"To explore these questions , let ’s start by focusing on a specific disease , sickle - cell anemia , and how it might affect two infected sisters .",0
5769,"Sickle - cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells , which are normally round , take on a crescent - like shape ( [ link ] ) .",1
5770,Watch this interview with renowned evolutionary psychologist David Buss for an explanation of how a psychologist approaches evolution and how this approach fits within the field of social science .,0
5771,"A single gene may have multiple possible variations , or alleles .",0
5772,An allele is a specific version of a gene .,1
5773,"So , a given gene may code for the trait of hair color , and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has . When a sperm and egg fuse , their 23 chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with 23 pairs of chromosomes .",0
5774,"Most traits are controlled by multiple genes , but some traits are controlled by one gene .",0
5775,"A characteristic like cleft chin , for example , is influenced by a single gene from each parent .",0
5776,"In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b. ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele .",1
5777,Sickle - cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes .,0
5778,"For example , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts .",1
5779,"If someone with this condition goes untreated , he or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function , seizures , and increased risk of various psychiatric disorders .",0
5780,Gene mutations provide one source of harmful genes .,0
5781,"A mutation is a sudden , permanent change in a gene .",1
5782,"While many mutations can be harmful or lethal , once in a while , a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation .",0
5783,"In another approach to gene - environment interactions , the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways .",1
5784,"In other words , researchers study how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes .",0
5785,Genes affect more than our physical characteristics .,0
5786,"Indeed , scientists have found genetic linkages to a number of behavioral characteristics , ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality ( for examples , see Mustanski et al . , 2005 ; Comings , Gonzales , Saucier , Johnson , & MacMurray , 2000 ) .",0
5787,"Glial cells , which outnumber neurons ten to one , are traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons , both physically and metabolically .",0
5788,"Glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built , help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication , provide insulation to neurons , transport nutrients and waste products , and mediate immune responses .",1
5789,"Neurons , on the other hand , serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system .",0
5790,"Like all cells , neurons consist of several different parts , each serving a specialized function ( [ link ] ) .",0
5791,A neuron ’s outer surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane .,0
5792,"This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules without an electrical charge to pass through it , while stopping larger or highly charged molecules .",1
5793,"The neuron is a small information processor , and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons .",0
5794,"These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon , which ends at multiple terminal buttons .",0
5795,"The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical messengers of the nervous system .",1
5796,"In healthy individuals , the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons , where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse ( [ link ] ) .",0
5797,The synapse is a very small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs .,1
5798,"Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron .",0
5799,The neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate — a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different .,0
5800,"This difference in charge across the membrane , called the membrane potential , provides energy for the signal .",1
5801,"With this influx of positive ions , the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive .",0
5802,"If that charge reaches a certain level , called the threshold of excitation , the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins . Many additional pores open , causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane potential , the peak action potential .",1
5803,"At the peak of the spike , the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open .",0
5804,"Because it is all or none , the action potential is recreated , or propagated , at its full strength at every point along the axon .",0
5805,"Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker , it does not fade away as it travels down the axon .",0
5806,"Agonists are chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and , thus , strengthen its effects .",1
5807,"An antagonist , on the other hand , blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor .",1
5808,Agonist and antagonist drugs are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person ’s condition .,0
5809,The autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be outside the realm of voluntary control .,1
5810,It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions ( [ link ] ) .,0
5811,"His pupils dilate , his heart rate and blood pressure increase , his bladder relaxes , his liver releases glucose , and adrenaline surges into his bloodstream .",1
5812,"This constellation of physiological changes , known as the fight or flight response , allows the body access to energy reserves and heightened sensory capacity so that it might fight off a threat or run away to safety .",0
5813,"When the spinal cord is damaged in a particular segment , all lower segments are cut off from the brain , causing paralysis .",0
5814,"Therefore , the lower on the spine damage is , the fewer functions an injured individual loses . The Two HemispheresThe surface of the brain , known as the cerebral cortex , is very uneven , characterized by a distinctive pattern of folds or bumps , known as gyri ( singular : gyrus ) , and grooves , known as sulci ( singular : sulcus ) , shown in [ link ] .",1
5815,These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers .,0
5816,"The two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of neural fibers known as the corpus callosum , consisting of about 200 million axons .",1
5817,"The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side . Normally , we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day - to - day functions , but there are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well .",0
5818,"The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning , motor control , emotion , and language .",0
5819,"It contains the motor cortex , which is involved in planning and coordinating movement ; the prefrontal cortex , which is responsible for higher - level cognitive functioning ; and Broca ’s area , which is essential for language production .",1
5820,"The brain ’s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’s senses .",1
5821,"It contains the somatosensory cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as touch , temperature , and pain .",1
5822,"The temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the temples ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language .",1
5823,"The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .",1
5824,"Wernicke ’s area , important for speech comprehension , is also located here .",0
5825,"Other Areas of the ForebrainOther areas of the forebrain , located beneath the cerebral cortex , include the thalamus and the limbic system .",0
5826,The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain .,1
5827,"The limbic system is made up of a number of different structures , but three of the most important are the hippocampus , the amygdala , and the hypothalamus ( [ link ] ) .",0
5828,The hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory .,1
5829,The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .,1
5830,"In 1953 , Henry Gustav Molaison ( H. M. ) was a 27-year - old man who experienced severe seizures .",0
5831,"In an attempt to control his seizures , H. M. underwent brain surgery to remove his hippocampus and amygdala .",0
5832,The substantia nigra ( Latin for “ black substance ” ) and the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) are also located in the midbrain ( [ link ] ) .,0
5833,"Both regions contain cell bodies that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine , and both are critical for movement .",0
5834,"The medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system , such as breathing , blood pressure , and heart rate .",1
5835,"The word pons literally means “ bridge , ” and as the name suggests , the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord .",1
5836,It also is involved in regulating brain activity during sleep .,0
5837,Brain ImagingYou have learned how brain injury can provide information about the functions of different parts of the brain .,0
5838,"Increasingly , however , we are able to obtain that information using brain imaging techniques on individuals who have not suffered brain injury .",0
5839,"In this section , we take a more in - depth look at some of the techniques that are available for imaging the brain , including techniques that rely on radiation , magnetic fields , or electrical activity within the brain .",0
5840,"In magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , a person is placed inside a machine that generates a strong magnetic field .",1
5841,The magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body ’s cells to move .,0
5842,The endocrine system consists of a series of glands that produce chemical substances known as hormones ( [ link ] ) .,1
5843,"Like neurotransmitters , hormones are chemical messengers that must bind to a receptor in order to send their signal .",1
5844,"The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) .",1
5845,The pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and glucagon .,1
5846,"Any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive , strict guidelines designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm .",0
5847,Any research institution that receives federal support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board ( IRB ) .,0
5848,"The IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution ’s administration , scientists , and community members ( [ link ] ) .",1
5849,"For example , if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire , we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants’ responses .",0
5850,"In cases where deception is involved , participants must receive a full debriefing upon conclusion of the study — complete , honest information about the purpose of the experiment , how the data collected will be used , the reasons why deception was necessary , and information about how to obtain additional information about the study .",0
5851,"Whereas IRBs review research proposals that involve human participants , animal experimental proposals are reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) .",0
5852,"An IACUC consists of institutional administrators , scientists , veterinarians , and community members .",1
5853,The sign — positive or negative — of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship ( [ link ] ) .,0
5854,A positive correlation means that the variables move in the same direction .,1
5855,"Put another way , it means that as one variable increases so does the other , and conversely , when one variable decreases so does the other .",0
5856,"However , correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about cause and effect .",0
5857,"While variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other , it could also be that some other factor , a confounding variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest .",0
5858,"In the ice cream / crime rate example mentioned earlier , temperature is a confounding variable that could account for the relationship between the two variables .",0
5859,Often we read or hear about them and simply accept the information as valid .,0
5860,"Or , we have a hunch about how something works and then look for evidence to support that hunch , ignoring evidence that would tell us our hunch is false ; this is known as confirmation bias .",1
5861,"Other times , we find illusory correlations based on the information that comes most easily to mind , even if that information is severely limited .",0
5862,The two groups are designed to be the same except for one difference— experimental manipulation .,0
5863,"The experimental group gets the experimental manipulation — that is , the treatment or variable being tested ( in this case , violent TV images)—and the control group does not .",1
5864,"Since experimental manipulation is the only difference between the experimental and control groups , we can be sure that any differences between the two are due to experimental manipulation rather than chance .",0
5865,"By being blind to which child is in which group , we protect against those biases .",0
5866,"This situation is a single - blind study , meaning that one of the groups ( participants ) are unaware as to which group they are in ( experiment or control group ) while the researcher who developed the experiment knows which participants are in each group .",0
5867,"To achieve this , we must pay attention to two important variables , or things that can be changed , in any experimental study : the independent variable and the dependent variable .",0
5868,An independent variable is manipulated or controlled by the experimenter .,1
5869,"In a well - designed experimental study , the independent variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups .",0
5870,"If possible , we should use a random sample ( there are other types of samples , but for the purposes of this chapter , we will focus on random samples ) .",0
5871,A random sample is a subset of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected .,1
5872,Random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the participating individuals are representative of the larger population .,0
5873,"Once data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups , a statistical analysis is conducted to find out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups .",0
5874,A statistical analysis determines how likely any difference found is due to chance ( and thus not meaningful ) .,0
5875,Reliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection .,0
5876,Reliability refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result .,1
5877,"In the context of psychological research , this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent , reproducible ways .",0
5878,"If scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior , focusing attention on such a special group of people can make it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole .",0
5879,Generalizing refers to the ability to apply the findings of a particular research project to larger segments of society .,1
5880,"Again , case studies provide enormous amounts of information , but since the cases are so specific , the potential to apply what ’s learned to the average person may be very limited .",0
5881,"The greatest benefit of naturalistic observation is the validity , or accuracy , of information collected unobtrusively in a natural setting .",0
5882,"Having individuals behave as they normally would in a given situation means that we have a higher degree of ecological validity , or realism , than we might achieve with other research approaches .",1
5883,"Often , psychologists develop surveys as a means of gathering data .",0
5884,"Surveys are lists of questions to be answered by research participants , and can be delivered as paper - and - pencil questionnaires , administered electronically , or conducted verbally ( [ link ] ) .",1
5885,"Generally , the survey itself can be completed in a short time , and the ease of administering a survey makes it easy to collect data from a large number of people .",0
5886,"When we test the same group of individuals repeatedly over an extended period of time , we are conducting longitudinal research .",1
5887,Longitudinal research is a research design in which data - gathering is administered repeatedly over an extended period of time .,1
5888,"For example , we may survey a group of individuals about their dietary habits at age 20 , retest them a decade later at age 30 , and then again at age 40 .",0
5889,"In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others , such as intuition and personal experience , the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim .",0
5890,"Scientific knowledge is empirical : It is grounded in objective , tangible evidence that can be observed time and time again , regardless of who is observing . While behavior is observable , the mind is not .",1
5891,"If someone is crying , we can see behavior .",0
5892,"Facts are observable realities , and opinions are personal judgments , conclusions , or attitudes that may or may not be accurate .",1
5893,"In the scientific community , facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research . THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHScientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method .",0
5894,"Basically , ideas ( in the form of theories and hypotheses ) are tested against the real world ( in the form of empirical observations ) , and those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world , and so on .",1
5895,"A hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct , and it is often worded as an if - then statement ( e.g. , if I study all night , I will get a passing grade on the test ) .",1
5896,The hypothesis is extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world .,0
5897,"Psyche comes to represent the human soul ’s triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness ( Bulfinch , 1855 ) ; in fact , the Greek word psyche means soul , and it is often represented as a butterfly .",1
5898,"The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) .",0
5899,"In most areas of psychology , this means earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology .",0
5900,"Literally , PhD refers to a doctor of philosophy degree , but here , philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se .",1
5901,"Rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences . The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation .",0
5902,"Individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral degree , which is known as a PsyD .",0
5903,A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology .,0
5904,"PsyD programs generally place less emphasis on research - oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context ( Norcorss & Castle , 2002 ) .",0
5905,"Evolutionary psychology , and specifically , the evolutionary psychology of humans , has enjoyed a resurgence in recent decades .",0
5906,"To be subject to evolution by natural selection , a behavior must have a significant genetic cause .",0
5907,Developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan .,1
5908,Developmental psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation .,0
5909,"More recently , the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach .",0
5910,"Rather than explaining how personality arises , research is focused on identifying personality traits , measuring these traits , and determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any given situation .",0
5911,"Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals .",1
5912,"Until then , you will be introduced to one of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted .",0
5913,Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience .,0
5914,"After the holocaust , in 1961 , a Nazi war criminal , Adolf Eichmann , who was accused of committing mass atrocities , was put on trial .",0
5915,"Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological , psychological , and sociocultural factors . This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model ( [ link ] ) .",1
5916,"Health psychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy , education , intervention , and research .",0
5917,"As such , it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology ; however , some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research .",0
5918,"Counseling psychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional , social , vocational , and health - related outcomes in individuals who are considered psychologically healthy .",1
5919,Wilhelm Wundt ( 1832–1920 ) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist .,0
5920,His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873 .,0
5921,William James ( 1842–1910 ) was the first American psychologist who espoused a different perspective on how psychology should operate ( [ link ] ) .,0
5922,James was introduced to Darwin ’s theory of evolution by natural selection and accepted it as an explanation of an organism ’s characteristics .,0
5923,"According to Freud , the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis , by examinations of the first words that came to people ’s minds , and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue .",0
5924,"Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the role of a person ’s unconscious , as well as early childhood experiences , and this particular perspective dominated clinical psychology for several decades ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) .",1
5925,John B. Watson ( 1878–1958 ) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred during the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University ( [ link ] ) .,0
5926,"While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience , Watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed .",0
5927,The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior indicator such as a lever or a button .,1
5928,"When the animal pushes the button or lever , the box is able to deliver a positive reinforcement of the behavior ( such as food ) or a punishment ( such as a noise ) or a token conditioner ( such as a light ) that is correlated with either the positive reinforcement or punishment .",0
5929,"Carl Rogers ( 1902–1987 ) was also an American psychologist who , like Maslow , emphasized the potential for good that exists within all people ( [ link ] ) .",0
5930,Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client - centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy .,0
5931,We might even describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep .,0
5932,Sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness .,1
5933,"Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness , thought , and behavior .",1
5934,"This pattern of temperature fluctuation , which repeats every day , is one example of a circadian rhythm .",0
5935,A circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about 24 hours .,1
5936,"Our sleep - wake cycle , which is linked to our environment ’s natural light - dark cycle , is perhaps the most obvious example of a circadian rhythm , but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate , blood pressure , blood sugar , and body temperature .",0
5937,The brain ’s clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) .,0
5938,"The axons of light - sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the SCN based on the amount of light present , allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world ( Klein , Moore , & Reppert , 1991 ; Welsh , Takahashi , & Kay , 2010 ) ( [ link ] ) .",0
5939,"These individual differences in circadian patterns of activity are known as a person ’s chronotype , and research demonstrates that morning larks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation ( Taillard , Philip , Coste , Sagaspe , & Bioulac , 2003 ) .",1
5940,Sleep regulation refers to the brain ’s control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well as coordinating this cycle with the outside world .,1
5941,Individuals who do rotating shift work are also likely to experience disruptions in circadian cycles .,0
5942,Rotating shift work refers to a work schedule that changes from early to late on a daily or weekly basis .,1
5943,"For example , a person may work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Monday , 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday , and 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday .",0
5944,Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound following sleep deprivation .,0
5945,Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep - deprived individual will tend to take a shorter time to fall asleep during subsequent opportunities for sleep .,1
5946,"Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography ( EEG ) , and different phases of sleep can be differentiated using EEG as well ( [ link]).This is a segment of a polysonograph ( PSG ) , a recording of several physical variables during sleep .",1
5947,Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness .,0
5948,"In contrast , non - REM ( NREM ) sleep is subdivided into four stages distinguished from each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves .",0
5949,"The first four stages of sleep are NREM sleep , while the fifth and final stage of sleep is REM sleep .",0
5950,"As an individual continues through stage 1 sleep , there is an increase in theta wave activity .",0
5951,"Theta waves are even lower frequency ( 4–7 Hz ) , higher amplitude brain waves than alpha waves .",1
5952,"It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1 sleep ; in fact , people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep .",0
5953,"In addition , the appearance of K - complexes is often associated with stage 2 sleep .",0
5954,A K - complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some cases occur in response to environmental stimuli .,1
5955,"Thus , K - complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments ( Halász , 1993 ; Steriade & Amzica , 1998 ) .",0
5956,Freud made distinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams .,0
5957,"Manifest content is the actual content , or storyline , of a dream .",1
5958,"Latent content , on the other hand , refers to the hidden meaning of a dream .",1
5959,"Among a variety of neurobiological evidence , John Hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general .",0
5960,Lucid dreams are dreams in which certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during a dream state .,1
5961,"In a lucid dream , a person becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming , and as such , they can control the dream ’s content ( LaBerge , 1990 ) .",0
5962,"In sleepwalking , or somnambulism , the sleeper engages in relatively complex behaviors ranging from wandering about to driving an automobile .",1
5963,"During periods of sleepwalking , sleepers often have their eyes open , but they are not responsive to attempts to communicate with them .",0
5964,"Night terrors result in a sense of panic in the sufferer and are often accompanied by screams and attempts to escape from the immediate environment ( Mahowald & Schenck , 2000 ) .",1
5965,"Although individuals suffering from night terrors appear to be awake , they generally have no memories of the events that occurred , and attempts to console them are ineffective .",0
5966,"Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when an individual ’s airway becomes blocked during sleep , and air is prevented from entering the lungs .",1
5967,"In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005).One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .",1
5968,"A continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper ’s nose and mouth , which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person ’s airways , forcing them to remain open , as shown in [ link ] .",1
5969,"Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section , a person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times .",0
5970,"These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness , and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles .",1
5971,A person who has a substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to and continues to use that substance despite experiencing significant adverse consequences .,0
5972,"In individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder , there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence . Physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions — the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use .",1
5973,"In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .",1
5974,Drug withdrawal includes a variety of negative symptoms experienced when drug use is discontinued .,1
5975,These symptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug .,0
5976,"In recent years , methamphetamine ( meth ) use has become increasingly widespread .",0
5977,"Methamphetamine is a type of amphetamine that can be made from ingredients that are readily available ( e.g. , medications containing pseudoephedrine , a compound found in many over - the - counter cold and flu remedies ) .",1
5978,"Despite recent changes in laws designed to make obtaining pseudoephedrine more difficult , methamphetamine continues to be an easily accessible and relatively inexpensive drug option ( Shukla , Crump , & Chrisco , 2012 ) .",0
5979,"Nicotine is most commonly used in the form of tobacco products like cigarettes or chewing tobacco ; therefore , there is a tremendous interest in developing effective smoking cessation techniques .",0
5980,"To date , people have used a variety of nicotine replacement therapies in addition to various psychotherapeutic options in an attempt to discontinue their use of tobacco products .",0
5981,"In general , smoking cessation programs may be effective in the short term , but it is unclear whether these effects persist ( Cropley , Theadom , Pravettoni , & Webb , 2008 ; Levitt , Shaw , Wong , & Kaczorowski , 2007 ; Smedslund , Fisher , Boles , & Lichtenstein , 2004 ) .",0
5982,"Still , people experiencing opioid withdrawal may be given methadone to make withdrawal from the drug less difficult .",0
5983,Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs .,1
5984,Methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone .,0
5985,A hallucinogen is one of a class of drugs that results in profound alterations in sensory and perceptual experiences ( [ link ] ) .,1
5986,"In some cases , users experience vivid visual hallucinations .",0
5987,Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific types of stimuli .,1
5988,"When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor , sensation has occurred .",0
5989,"For example , light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye .",0
5990,"It has been estimated that on a clear night , the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can detect a candle flame 30 miles away ( Okawa & Sampath , 2007 ) .",0
5991,"Under quiet conditions , the hair cells ( the receptor cells of the inner ear ) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away ( Galanter , 1962).It is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness — these are called subliminal messages .",1
5992,A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain : This is an absolute threshold .,0
5993,Perception involves both bottom - up and top - down processing .,0
5994,Bottom - up processing refers to the fact that perceptions are built from sensory input .,1
5995,"On the other hand , how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge , our experiences , and our thoughts .",0
5996,"Because participants were so focused on the number of times the white team was passing the ball , they completely tuned out other visual information .",0
5997,Failure to notice something that is completely visible because of a lack of attention is called inattentional blindness .,1
5998,"For example , Marshall Segall , Donald Campbell , and Melville Herskovits ( 1963 ) published the results of a multinational study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non - Western cultures , and vice versa .",0
5999,"One such illusion that Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller - Lyer illusion ( [ link ] ) : The lines appear to be different lengths , but they are actually the same length .",0
6000,Wavelength is directly related to the frequency of a given wave form .,0
6001,"Frequency refers to the number of waves that pass a given point in a given time period and is often expressed in terms of hertz ( Hz ) , or cycles per second .",1
6002,"Longer wavelengths will have lower frequencies , and shorter wavelengths will have higher frequencies ( [ link ] ) .",0
6003,Higher amplitudes are associated with louder sounds .,0
6004,"Loudness is measured in terms of decibels ( dB ) , a logarithmic unit of sound intensity .",1
6005,A typical conversation would correlate with 60 dB ; a rock concert might check in at 120 dB ( [ link ] ) .,0
6006,Light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil .,0
6007,The cornea is the transparent covering over the eye .,1
6008,"It serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world , and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye .",0
6009,"After passing through the pupil , light crosses the lens , a curved , transparent structure that serves to provide additional focus .",1
6010,The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects .,0
6011,"These photoreceptor cells , known as cones , are light - detecting cells .",0
6012,The cones are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions .,1
6013,Cones are very sensitive to acute detail and provide tremendous spatial resolution .,0
6014,The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain .,0
6015,"There is a point in the visual field called the blind spot : Even when light from a small object is focused on the blind spot , we do not see it .",1
6016,"We are not consciously aware of our blind spots for two reasons : First , each eye gets a slightly different view of the visual field ; therefore , the blind spots do not overlap .",0
6017,Each of these cone types is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light .,0
6018,"According to the trichromatic theory of color vision , shown in [ link ] , all colors in the spectrum can be produced by combining red , green , and blue .",1
6019,"Through the work of scientists in the late 18th century , the main features of the electrostatic force — the existence of two types of charge , the observation that like charges repel , unlike charges attract , and the decrease of force with distance — were eventually refined , and expressed as a mathematical formula .",1
6020,"The mathematical formula for the electrostatic force is called Coulomb ’s law after the French physicist Charles Coulomb ( 1736–1806 ) , who performed experiments and first proposed a formula to calculate it .",1
6021,"For example , a charged rubber comb attracts neutral bits of paper from a distance via the Coulomb force .",0
6022,It is very useful to think of an object being surrounded in space by a force field .,0
6023,The force field carries the force to another object ( called a test object ) some distance away .,0
6024,"We pretend that there is a positive test charge , qq size 12{q } { } , at point O , which allows us to determine the direction of the fields E1E1 size 12{E rSub { size 8{1 } } } { } and E2E2 size 12{E rSub { size 8{2 } } } { } .",0
6025,"Once those fields are found , the total field can be determined using vector addition . Solution",0
6026,Its 10 electrons ( 8 from the oxygen atom and 2 from the two hydrogen atoms ) tend to remain closer to the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nuclei .,0
6027,"This creates two centers of equal and opposite charges — what is called a dipole , as illustrated in [ link ] .",1
6028,"The magnitude of the dipole is called the dipole moment . These two centers of charge will terminate some of the electric field lines coming from a free charge , as on a DNA molecule .",1
6029,Conductors contain free charges that move easily .,1
6030,"When excess charge is placed on a conductor or the conductor is put into a static electric field , charges in the conductor quickly respond to reach a steady state called electrostatic equilibrium .",1
6031,Another device that makes use of some of these principles is a Faraday cage .,0
6032,This is a metal shield that encloses a volume .,1
6033,The study of electrostatics has proven useful in many areas .,0
6034,This module covers just a few of the many applications of electrostatics .,0
6035,The heart of the process is shown in simplified form in [ link].A selenium - coated aluminum drum is sprayed with positive charge from points on a device called a corotron .,0
6036,Selenium is a substance with an interesting property — it is a photoconductor .,0
6037,"That is , selenium is an insulator when in the dark and a conductor when exposed to light .",1
6038,"The ink jet printer , commonly used to print computer - generated text and graphics , also employs electrostatics .",1
6039,"A nozzle makes a fine spray of tiny ink droplets , which are then given an electrostatic charge .",0
6040,This implies that a conductor is an equipotential surface in static situations .,0
6041,"There can be no voltage difference across the surface of a conductor , or charges will flow .",0
6042,One of the uses of this fact is that a conductor can be fixed at zero volts by connecting it to the earth with a good conductor — a process called grounding .,1
6043,Grounding can be a useful safety tool .,0
6044,( Recall that E = V / dE = V / d size 12{E = V / d } { } for a parallel plate capacitor . ),0
6045,"Also shown in [ link ] are maximum electric field strengths in V / m , called dielectric strengths , for several materials .",0
6046,These are the fields above which the material begins to break down and conduct .,0
6047,Ohm ’s law ( like Hooke ’s law ) is not universally valid .,0
6048,The many substances for which Ohm ’s law holds are called ohmic .,0
6049,"These include good conductors like copper and aluminum , and some poor conductors under certain circumstances .",0
6050,"Most well - known applications , however , use a time - varying voltage source .",0
6051,Alternating current ( AC ) is the flow of electric charge that periodically reverses direction .,1
6052,"If the source varies periodically , particularly sinusoidally , the circuit is known as an alternating current circuit .",0
6053,"A thermal hazard is one where excessive electric power causes undesired thermal effects , such as starting a fire in the wall of a house .",1
6054,A shock hazard occurs when electric current passes through a person .,1
6055,"Shocks range in severity from painful , but otherwise harmless , to heart - stopping lethality .",1
6056,The sheer number of nerve cells and the incredibly greater number of connections between them makes this system the subtle wonder that it is .,0
6057,Nerve conduction is a general term for electrical signals carried by nerve cells .,1
6058,"It is one aspect of bioelectricity , or electrical effects in and created by biological systems .",1
6059,An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) is a record of the voltages created by the wave of depolarization and subsequent repolarization in the heart .,1
6060,Voltages between pairs of electrodes placed on the chest are vector components of the voltage wave on the heart .,0
6061,When are resistors in series ?,0

6141,The two major types of light - sensing cells ( photoreceptors ) in the retina are rods and cones .,1
6142,Rods are more sensitive than cones by a factor of about 1000 and are solely responsible for peripheral vision as well as vision in very dark environments .,0
6143,"One theory that takes various factors into account was advanced by Edwin Land ( 1909 – 1991 ) , the creative founder of the Polaroid Corporation .",0
6144,"Land proposed , based partly on his many elegant experiments , that the three types of cones are organized into systems called retinexes .",1

6157,The Sun and many other light sources produce waves that are randomly polarized ( see [ link ] ) .,1
6158,Such light is said to be unpolarized because it is composed of many waves with all possible directions of polarization .,0
6159,"Polaroid materials , invented by the founder of Polaroid Corporation , Edwin Land , act as a polarizing slit for light , allowing only polarization in one direction to pass through .",1
6160,Another interesting phenomenon associated with polarized light is the ability of some crystals to split an unpolarized beam of light into two .,1

6174,Not all molecules have this property .,0
6175,"Air , for example , is nearly transparent to many IR frequencies . Microwaves are the highest frequencies that can be produced by electronic circuits , although they are also produced naturally .",1

6182,"The English scientist William Crookes , among others , continued to study what for some time were called Crookes tubes , wherein electrons are freed from atoms and molecules in the rarefied gas inside the tube and are accelerated from the cathode ( negative ) to the anode ( positive ) by the high potential .",1
6183,"These “ cathode rays ” collide with the gas atoms and molecules and excite them , resulting in the emission of electromagnetic ( EM ) radiation that makes the electrons’ path visible as a ray that spreads and fades as it moves away from the cathode . Gas discharge tubes today are most commonly called cathode - ray tubes , because the rays originate at the cathode .",1

6525,"All the states except Rhode Island chose delegates to send to the meeting , a total of seventy men in all , but many did not attend .",0
6526,Those who favored a nation free of the influence of slavery feared that southerners might attempt to make it a permanent part of American society .,0
6527,"The only decision that all could agree on was the election of George Washington , the former commander of the Continental Army and hero of the American Revolution , as the president of the convention .",0
6528,Delegates from small states objected to this Virginia Plan .,0
6529,"Another proposal , the New Jersey Plan , called for a unicameral legislature with one house , in which each state would have one vote .",1
6530,"Thus , smaller states would have the same power in the national legislature as larger states .",0
6531,"The first three articles divide the national government into three branches — Congress , the executive branch , and the federal judiciary — and describe the powers and responsibilities of each .",0
6532,"In Article I , ten sections describe the structure of Congress , the basis for representation and the requirements for serving in Congress , the length of Congressional terms , and the powers of Congress .",0
6533,"The national legislature created by the article reflects the compromises reached by the delegates regarding such issues as representation , slavery , and national power .",0
6534,"Although debates over slavery and representation in Congress occupied many at the convention , the chief concern was the challenge of increasing the authority of the national government while ensuring that it did not become too powerful .",0
6535,"The framers resolved this problem through a separation of powers , dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one , as shown in [ link ] .",0
6536,"They also created a system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others , thus requiring them to work together .",0
6537,The strongest guarantee that the power of the national government would be restricted and the states would retain a degree of sovereignty was the framers’ creation of a federal system of government .,0
6538,"In a federal system , power is divided between the federal ( or national ) government and the state governments .",1
6539,"Great or explicit powers , called enumerated powers , were granted to the federal government to declare war , impose taxes , coin and regulate currency , regulate foreign and interstate commerce , raise and maintain an army and a navy , maintain a post office , make treaties with foreign nations and with Native American tribes , and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants .",1
6540,"Although the states retained a considerable degree of sovereignty , the supremacy clause in Article VI of the Constitution proclaimed that the Constitution , laws passed by Congress , and treaties made by the federal government were “ the supreme Law of the Land . ” In the event of a conflict between the states and the national government , the national government would triumph .",0
6541,"Furthermore , although the federal government was to be limited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution , Article I provided for the expansion of Congressional powers if needed .",0
6542,But many people resisted increasing the powers of the national government at the expense of the states .,0
6543,"Virginia ’s Patrick Henry , for example , feared that the newly created office of president would place excessive power in the hands of one man .",0
6544,He also disapproved of the federal government ’s new ability to tax its citizens .,0
6545,"On the question of ratification , citizens quickly separated into two groups : Federalists and Anti - Federalists .",0
6546,The Federalists supported it .,0
6547,"They tended to be among the elite members of society — wealthy and well - educated landowners , businessmen , and former military commanders who believed a strong government would be better for both national defense and economic growth .",1
6548,"The Constitution contained no provisions for government support of churches or of religious education , and Article VI explicitly forbade the use of religious tests to determine eligibility for public office .",0
6549,"This caused many , like Henry Abbot of North Carolina , to fear that government would be placed in the hands of “ pagans .",0
6550,.,0
6551,"Furthermore , tyranny could not arise in a government in which “ the legislature necessarily predominates . ” Finally , the desire of office holders in each branch of government to exercise the powers given to them , described as “ personal motives , ” would encourage them to limit any attempt by the other branches to overstep their authority .",1
6552,"According to Madison , “ Ambition must be made to counteract ambition . ”",0
6553,15 .,0
6554,"In fact , presidents long followed George Washington ’s example and limited themselves to two terms .",0
6555,"Only in 1951 , after Franklin Roosevelt had been elected four times , was the Twenty - Second Amendment passed to restrict the presidency to two terms .",1
6556,"Of these , only ten were accepted by three - quarters of the state legislatures .",0
6557,"In 1791 , these first ten amendments were added to the Constitution and became known as the Bill of Rights .",1
6558,The prohibition in the First Amendment against the establishment of an official church by the federal government differed significantly from both English precedent and the practice of several states that had official churches .,0
6559,"The Fourth Amendment , which protects Americans from unwarranted search and seizure of their property , was also new .",1
6560,Other amendments rectify problems that have arisen over the years or that reflect changing times .,0
6561,"For example , the Seventeenth Amendment , ratified in 1913 , gave voters the right to directly elect U.S. senators .",1
6562,"The Twentieth Amendment , which was ratified in 1933 during the Great Depression , moved the date of the presidential inauguration from March to January .",1
6563,"The Thirteenth , Fourteenth , and Fifteenth Amendments , ratified at the end of the Civil War , changed the lives of African Americans who had been held in slavery .",0
6564,The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States .,1
6565,The Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to African Americans and equal protection under the law regardless of race or color .,1
6566,"The Fifteenth Amendment gave men the right to vote regardless of race or color , but women were still prohibited from voting in most states .",1
6567,"After many years of campaigns for suffrage , as shown in [ link ] , the Nineteenth Amendment finally gave women the right to vote in 1920 .",1
6568,The last great extension of the suffrage occurred in 1971 in the midst of the Vietnam War .,0
6569,The Twenty - Sixth Amendment reduced the voting age from twenty - one to eighteen .,1
6570,Many people had complained that the young men who were fighting in Vietnam should have the right to vote for or against those making decisions that might literally mean life or death for them .,0
6571,"Federalism is an institutional arrangement that creates two relatively autonomous levels of government , each possessing the capacity to act directly on behalf of the people with the authority granted to it by the national constitution . See John Kincaid .",1
6572,5942 .,0
6573,Division of power can also occur via a unitary structure or confederation ( [ link ] ) .,0
6574,"In contrast to federalism , a unitary system makes subnational governments dependent on the national government , where significant authority is concentrated .",1
6575,"Before the late 1990s , the United Kingdom ’s unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power .",0
6576,The Constitution contains several provisions that direct the functioning of U.S. federalism .,0
6577,"Some delineate the scope of national and state power , while others restrict it .",0
6578,"What these Anti - Federalists sought was further assurance that the national government ’s capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted , which the first ten amendments ( Bill of Rights ) provided .",0
6579,"The Tenth Amendment affirms the states’ reserved powers : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ” Indeed , state constitutions had bills of rights , which the first Congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the Constitution .",1
6580,"Like the federal government , the states can not violate personal freedoms by suspending the writ of habeas corpus , passing bills of attainder , or enacting ex post facto laws .",0
6581,"Furthermore , the Fourteenth Amendment , ratified in 1868 , prohibits the states from denying citizens the rights to which they are entitled by the Constitution , due process of law , or the equal protection of the laws .",1
6582,"Lastly , three civil rights amendments — the Fifteenth , Nineteenth , and Twenty - Sixth — prevent both the states and the federal government from abridging citizens’ right to vote based on race , sex , and age .",0
6583,The movement for marriage equality has put the full faith and credit clause to the test in recent decades .,0
6584,"In light of Baehr v. Lewin , a 1993 ruling in which the Hawaii Supreme Court asserted that the state ’s ban on same - sex marriage was unconstitutional , a number of states became worried that they would be required to recognize those marriage certificates . Baehr v. Lewin .",1
6585,5960 .,0
6586,"Although the data reflect 2013 results , the patterns we see in the figure give us a good idea of how governments have funded their activities in recent years .",0
6587,"For the federal government , 47 percent of 2013 revenue came from individual income taxes and 34 percent from payroll taxes , which combine Social Security tax and Medicare tax .",0
6588,"When the bank ’s charter expired in 1811 , Jeffersonian Democratic - Republicans prevailed in blocking its renewal .",0
6589,"However , the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the War of 1812 , coupled with the fragility of the country ’s financial system , convinced Congress and then - president James Madison to create the Second Bank of the United States in 1816 .",0
6590,The Supreme Court also sided with the federal government on the issue of whether states could tax federal property .,0
6591,"Under the supremacy clause of Article VI , legitimate national laws trump conflicting state laws .",1
6592,"As the court observed , “ the government of the Union , though limited in its powers , is supreme within its sphere of action and its laws , when made in pursuance of the constitution , form the supreme law of the land . ” Maryland ’s action violated national supremacy because “ the power to tax is the power to destroy . ” This second ruling established the principle of national supremacy , which prohibits states from meddling in the lawful activities of the national government .",1
6593,"First , interstate commerce was interpreted broadly to mean “ commercial intercourse ” among states , thus allowing Congress to regulate navigation .",1
6594,"Second , because the federal Licensing Act of 1793 , which regulated coastal commerce , was a constitutional exercise of Congress ’s authority under the commerce clause , federal law trumped the New York State license - monopoly law that had granted Ogden an exclusive steamboat operating license .",1
6595,"As Marshall pointed out , “ the acts of New York must yield to the law of Congress.”Gibbons v. Ogden , 22 U.S. 1 ( 1824 ) .",0
6596,A nullification crisis emerged in the 1830s over President Andrew Jackson ’s tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 .,0
6597,"Led by John Calhoun , President Jackson ’s vice president , nullifiers argued that high tariffs on imported goods benefited northern manufacturing interests while disadvantaging economies in the South .",0
6598,South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the Union .,0
6599,"Prior to the conflict , in Dred Scott v. Sandford , the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories . Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1857 ) .",1
6600,But the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led eleven southern states to secede from the United States because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery .,0
6601,"What was initially a conflict to preserve the Union became a conflict to end slavery when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , freeing all slaves in the rebellious states .",1
6602,The defeat of the South had a huge impact on the balance of power between the states and the national government in two important ways .,0
6603,The late 1870s ushered in a new phase in the evolution of U.S. federalism .,0
6604,"Under dual federalism , the states and national government exercise exclusive authority in distinctly delineated spheres of jurisdiction .",1
6605,"Like the layers of a cake , the levels of government do not blend with one another but rather are clearly defined .",0
6606,The Great Depression of the 1930s brought economic hardships the nation had never witnessed before ( [ link ] ) .,0
6607,"Between 1929 and 1933 , the national unemployment rate reached 25 percent , industrial output dropped by half , stock market assets lost more than half their value , thousands of banks went out of business , and the gross domestic product shrunk by one - quarter . Nicholas Crafts and Peter Fearon .",0
6608,The New Deal programs President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed as a means to tackle the Great Depression ran afoul of the dual - federalism mindset of the justices on the Supreme Court in the 1930s .,0
6609,"The court struck down key pillars of the New Deal — the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act , for example — on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states .",0
6610,"The court ’s obstructionist position infuriated Roosevelt , leading him in 1937 to propose a court - packing plan that would add one new justice for each one over the age of seventy , thus allowing the president to make a maximum of six new appointments .",0
6611,The New Deal changed the relationship Americans had with the national government .,0
6612,"Before the Great Depression , the government offered little in terms of financial aid , social benefits , and economic rights .",0
6613,"After the New Deal , it provided old - age pensions ( Social Security ) , unemployment insurance , agricultural subsidies , protections for organizing in the workplace , and a variety of other public services created during Roosevelt ’s administration .",1
6614,"Nowhere is this clearer than with respect to the social welfare and social insurance programs created during the New Deal and Great Society eras , most of which are administered by both state and federal authorities and are jointly funded .",0
6615,"The Social Security Act of 1935 , which created federal subsidies for state - administered programs for the elderly ; people with handicaps ; dependent mothers ; and children , gave state and local officials wide discretion over eligibility and benefit levels .",1
6616,"The unemployment insurance program , also created by the Social Security Act , requires states to provide jobless benefits , but it allows them significant latitude to decide the level of tax to impose on businesses in order to fund the program as well as the duration and replacement rate of unemployment benefits .",1
6617,"New federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency , reduces overall public spending , and improves policy outcomes .",1
6618,"During Nixon ’s administration , general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent .",0
6619,"The election of Ronald Reagan heralded the advent of a “ devolution revolution ” in U.S. federalism , in which the president pledged to return authority to the states according to the Constitution .",0
6620,"However , many would say that the years since the 9/11 attacks have swung the pendulum back in the direction of central federal power .",0
6621,"The creation of the Department of Homeland Security federalized disaster response power in Washington , and the Transportation Security Administration was created to federalize airport security .",1
6622,Broad new federal policies and mandates have also been carried out in the form of the Faith - Based Initiative and No Child Left Behind ( during the George W. Bush administration ) and the Affordable Care Act ( during Barack Obama ’s administration ) .,0
6623,The national government has used grants to influence state actions as far back as the Articles of Confederation when it provided states with land grants .,0
6624,"In the first half of the 1800s , land grants were the primary means by which the federal government supported the states .",0
6625,Block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds .,1
6626,"Examples of block grants include the Workforce Investment Act program , which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better - paying jobs , and the Surface Transportation Program , which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways , bridges , tunnels , sidewalks , and bicycle paths .",1
6627,"Finally , recipients of general revenue sharing faced the least restrictions on the use of federal grants .",0
6628,"However , congressional efforts to convert Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) to a block grant succeeded .",0
6629,"The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) block grant replaced the AFDC in 1996 , marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program ( which guarantees individual rights to benefits ) into a block grant .",0
6630,"Under the AFDC , the federal government had reimbursed states a portion of the costs they bore for running the program without placing a ceiling on the amount .",0
6631,"For example , Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes the federal government to withhold federal grants as well as file lawsuits against state and local officials for practicing racial discrimination .",1
6632,"Finally , some mandates come in the form of partial preemption regulations , whereby the federal government sets national regulatory standards but delegates the enforcement to state and local governments .",1
6633,A new piece of legislation aims to take this approach further .,0
6634,"The 2015 Unfunded Mandates and Information Transparency Act , HR 50 , passed the House early in 2015 before being referred to the Senate , where it waits committee consideration . U.S .",0
6635,Congress .,0
6636,"The Clery Act of 1990 , formally the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act , requires public and private colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs to disclose information about campus crime .",1
6637,"The Act is named after Jeanne Clery , who in 1986 was raped and murdered by a fellow student in her Lehigh University dorm room .",1
6638,"“ Discrediting ‘ Self Deportation’ as Immigration Policy , ” February 6 . http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/special-reports/discrediting-%E2%80%9Cself-deportation%E2%80%9D-immigration-policy The federal government filed suit to block the Arizona law , contending that it conflicted with federal immigration laws .",0
6639,"Arizona ’s law has also divided society , because some groups , like the Tea Party movement , have supported its tough stance against illegal immigrants , while other groups have opposed it for humanitarian and human - rights reasons ( [ link ] ) .",0
6640,"According to a poll of Latino voters in the state by Arizona State University researchers , 81 percent opposed this bill . Daniel González .",0
6641,"The court upheld the “ show me your papers ” provision , which authorizes police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest who they suspect is an illegal immigrant . Arizona v. United States , 567 U.S. _ _ ( 2012 ) .",0
6642,"However , in letting this provision stand , the court warned Arizona and other states with similar laws that they could face civil rights lawsuits if police officers applied it based on racial profiling . Julia Preston , “ Arizona Ruling Only a Narrow Opening for Other States , ” New York Times , 25 June 2012 .",0
6643,"All in all , Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s opinion embraced an expansive view of the U.S. government ’s authority to regulate immigration and aliens , describing it as broad and undoubted .",0
6644,"That authority derived from the legislative power of Congress to “ establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization , ” enumerated in the Constitution .",0
6645,"Edith Windsor , the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case United States v. Windsor , has become an icon of the marriage equality movement for her successful effort to force repeal the DOMA provision that denied married same - sex couples a host of federal provisions and protections .",1
6646,"In 2007 , after having lived together since the late 1960s , Windsor and her partner Thea Spyer were married in Canada , where same - sex marriage was legal .",0
6647,6041 .,0
6648,Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) was established in 1980 by a woman whose thirteen - year - old daughter had been killed by a drunk driver .,0
6649,"The organization lobbied state legislators to raise the drinking age and impose tougher penalties , but without success .",1
6650,The strategy anti - abortion advocates have used in recent years is another example of venue shopping .,0
6651,"In their attempts to limit abortion rights in the wake of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision making abortion legal nationwide , anti - abortion advocates initially targeted Congress in hopes of obtaining restrictive legislation . Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 ( 1973 ) .",1
6652,"Lack of progress at the national level prompted them to shift their focus to state legislators , where their advocacy efforts have been more successful .",0
6653,"By 2015 , for example , thirty - eight states required some form of parental involvement in a minor ’s decision to have an abortion , forty - six states allowed individual health - care providers to refuse to participate in abortions , and thirty - two states prohibited the use of public funds to carry out an abortion except when the woman ’s life is in danger or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest .",0
6654,Federalism also comes with drawbacks .,0
6655,"Chief among them are economic disparities across states , race - to - the - bottom dynamics ( i.e. , states compete to attract business by lowering taxes and regulations ) , and the difficulty of taking action on issues of national importance .",1
6656,Protests have erupted nationwide in response to the deaths of African Americans during interactions with police .,0
6657,"Many people were deeply troubled by the revelations of Edward Snowden ( [ link ] ) that U.S. government agencies are conducting widespread surveillance , capturing not only the conversations of foreign leaders and suspected terrorists but also the private communications of U.S. citizens , even those not suspected of criminal activity .",0
6658,"The idea that Americans — indeed , people in general — have fundamental rights and liberties was at the core of the arguments in favor of their independence .",0
6659,"In writing the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , Thomas Jefferson drew on the ideas of John Locke to express the colonists’ belief that they had certain inalienable or natural rights that no ruler had the power or authority to deny to his or her subjects .",0
6660,It was a scathing legal indictment of King George III for violating the colonists’ liberties .,0
6661,"Indeed , the Federalists did include in the Constitution some protections against legislative acts that might restrict the liberties of citizens , based on the history of real and perceived abuses by both British kings and parliaments as well as royal governors .",0
6662,"In Article I , Section 9 , the Constitution limits the power of Congress in three ways : prohibiting the passage of bills of attainder , prohibiting ex post facto laws , and limiting the ability of Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus .",0
6663,"Finally , the writ of habeas corpus is used in our common - law legal system to demand that a neutral judge decide whether someone has been lawfully detained .",1
6664,"Particularly in times of war , or even in response to threats against national security , the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts , often without access to lawyers or a defense , seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial .",0
6665,"The Federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of Congress , along with the limitations on those powers in Article I , Section 9 , would suffice , and no separate bill of rights was needed .",0
6666,"Alexander Hamilton , writing as Publius in Federalist No .",0
6667,"gued that the Constitution was “ merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation , ” rather than to concern itself with “ the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns . ” Hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous , because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected .",0
6668,"The Anti - Federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution would allow Congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the Constitution ’s authors ; thus , they held that a bill of rights was necessary .",0
6669,"One of the Anti - Federalists , Brutus , whom most scholars believe to be Robert Yates , wrote : “ The powers , rights , and authority , granted to the general government by this Constitution , are as complete , with respect to every object to which they extend , as that of any state government — It reaches to every thing which concerns human happiness — Life , liberty , and property , are under its controul [ sic ] .",0
6670,"There is the same reason , therefore , that the exercise of power , in this case , should be restrained within proper limits , as in that of the state governments.”Constitution Society , “ To the Citizens of the State of New - York , ” http://www.constitution.org/afp/brutus02.htm ( March 4 , 2016 ) .",0
6671,"The experience of the past two centuries has suggested that the Anti - Federalists may have been correct in this regard ; while the states retain a great deal of importance , the scope and powers of the national government are much broader today than in 1787—likely beyond even the imaginings of the Federalists themselves . The struggle to have rights clearly delineated and the decision of the framers to omit a bill of rights nearly derailed the ratification process .",0
6672,"In the decades following the Constitution ’s ratification , the Supreme Court declined to expand the Bill of Rights to curb the power of the states , most notably in the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore . Barron v. Baltimore , 32 U.S. 243 ( 1833 ) .",0
6673,"In this case , which dealt with property rights under the Fifth Amendment , the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government .",1
6674,"Explaining the court ’s ruling , Chief Justice John Marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that “ the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments ; as well as against that which might be attempted by their [ Federal ] government . ”",0
6675,"Representative John Bingham ( R - OH ) ( a ) is considered the author of the Fourteenth Amendment , adopted on July 9 , 1868 .",0
6676,"Influenced by his mentor , Salmon P. Chase , Bingham was a strong supporter of the antislavery cause ; after Chase lost the Republican presidential nomination to Abraham Lincoln ( b ) , Bingham became one of the president ’s most ardent supporters .",0
6677,"( To use an example from today , the punishment for speeding by an out - of - state driver can not be more severe than the punishment for an in - state driver ) .",0
6678,"Legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years ; some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire Bill of Rights ( or at least the first eight amendments ) to the states , while others have argued that only some rights are extended .",0
6679,"In 1999 , Justice John Paul Stevens , writing for a majority of the Supreme Court , argued in Saenz v. Roe that the clause protects the right to travel from one state to another . Saenz v. Roe , 526 U.S. 489 ( 1999 ) .",1
6680,"More recently , Justice Clarence Thomas argued in the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago ruling that the individual right to bear arms applied to the states because of this clause . McDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742 ( 2010).The second provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that pertains to applying the Bill of Rights to the states is the due process clause , which says , “ nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . ” This provision is similar to the Fifth Amendment in that it also refers to “ due process , ” a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials ( or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process ) .",1
6681,"Beginning in 1897 , the Supreme Court has found that various provisions of the Bill of Rights protecting these fundamental liberties must be upheld by the states , even if their state constitutions and laws do not protect them as fully as the Bill of Rights does — or at all .",0
6682,"This means there has been a process of selective incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the practices of the states ; in other words , the Constitution effectively inserts parts of the Bill of Rights into state laws and constitutions , even though it does n’t do so explicitly .",0
6683,"When cases arise to clarify particular issues and procedures , the Supreme Court decides whether state laws violate the Bill of Rights and are therefore unconstitutional .",0
6684,Another area in which the Supreme Court gradually moved to incorporate the Bill of Rights regards censorship and the Fourteenth Amendment .,0
6685,"In Near v. Minnesota ( 1931 ) , the Court disagreed with state courts regarding censorship and ruled it unconstitutional except in rare cases . Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 ( 1931 ) .",1
6686,The first of these two freedoms is known as the establishment clause .,0
6687,Congress is prohibited from creating or promoting a state - sponsored religion ( this now includes the states too ) .,1
6688,But some laws that may appear to establish certain religious practices are allowed .,0
6689,"For example , the courts have permitted religiously inspired blue laws that limit working hours or even shutter businesses on Sunday , the Christian day of rest , because by allowing people to practice their ( Christian ) faith , such rules may help ensure the “ health , safety , recreation , and general well - being ” of citizens .",1
6690,They have allowed restrictions on the sale of alcohol and sometimes other goods on Sunday for similar reasons .,0
6691,"To avoid serving in the Vietnam War , many people claimed to have a conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust .",0
6692,"However , the Supreme Court ruled in Gillette v. United States that to claim to be a conscientious objector , a person must be opposed to serving in any war , not just some wars . Gillette v. United States , 401 U.S. 437 ( 1971 ) .",1
6693,"In 1990 , the Supreme Court made a controversial decision substantially narrowing the Sherbert test in Employment Division v. Smith , more popularly known as “ the peyote case.”Employment Division , Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872 ( 1990 ) .",0
6694,"This case involved two men who were members of the Native American Church , a religious organization that uses the hallucinogenic peyote plant as part of its sacraments .",1
6695,"After being arrested for possession of peyote , the two men were fired from their jobs as counselors at a private drug rehabilitation clinic .",0
6696,"Such a conflict emerged in the 2014 Supreme Court case known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby . Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. , 573 U.S. _ _ ( 2014 ) .",0

6924,"If a gene is to remain turned off , or silenced , the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration .",0
6925,"n some eukaryotic genes , there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription .",1

6984,"This process is called carbon fixation , because CO2 is “ fixed ” from an inorganic form into organic molecules .",0
6985,"ommunication between cells is called intercellular signaling , and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling .",1
6986,"An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes : inter- means """" between """" ( for example , intersecting lines are those that cross each other ) and intra- means """" inside """" ( like intravenous).Chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small , usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands .",0
6987,"A ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule , in some cases , delivering a signal in the process .",1

7001,"n some cases , binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor , which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer .",1
7002,A dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules ( often identical ) join together .,1
7003,The binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other .,0

7011,An inhibitor is a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function .,1
7012,"In this case , the inhibitor is a protein called Iκ - B , which binds to the regulatory protein NF - κB .",0

7016,"hen the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level , specific gene expression is initiated , and the bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light .",0
7017,"Because the number of cells present in the environment ( cell density ) is the determining factor for signaling , bacterial signaling was named quorum sensing .",1

7024,"The condensed chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus ( top ) , removed from a cell in mitosis and spread out on a slide ( right ) , and artificially arranged according to length ( left ) ; an arrangement like this is called a karyotype .",1
7025,"n the first level of compaction , short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome ( [ link ] ) .",1

7042,"ytokinesis , or “ cell motion , ” is the second main stage of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells .",1
7043,Division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells .,0
7044,"ot all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory phases of interphase , closely followed by the mitotic phase .",0
7045,Cells in G0 phase are not actively preparing to divide .,0
7046,The cell is in a quiescent ( inactive ) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle .,1
7047,he genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto - oncogenes .,1
7048,"Proto - oncogenes are normal genes that , when mutated in certain ways , become oncogenes , genes that cause a cell to become cancerous .",1

7050,"wo groups of proteins , called cyclins and cyclin - dependent kinases ( Cdks ) , are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints .",1
7051,The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle in a predictable pattern ( [ link ] ) .,0
7052,"he packing proteins of bacteria are , however , related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes . The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell .",0
7053,"The starting point of replication , the origin , is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane ( [ link ] ) .",1
7054,"Replication of the DNA is bidirectional , moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously .",0
7055,"exual reproduction requires fertilization , the union of two cells from two individual organisms .",1
7056,"If those two cells each contain one set of chromosomes , then the resulting cell contains two sets of chromosomes .",0
7057,"uring DNA duplication in the S phase , each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies , called sister chromatids , that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins . Cohesin holds the chromatids together until anaphase II .",1
7058,"he synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non - sister homologous chromatids , a process called crossing over .",1
7059,"Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata ( singular = chiasma ) ( [ link]).In species such as humans , even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not homologous ( most of their genes differ ) , they have a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I .",0
7060,A partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology .,0
7061,"ollowing crossover , the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed .",0
7062,"At the end of prophase I , the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata ( [ link ] ) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible .",1
7063,ertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles .,0
7064,What happens between these two events depends on the organism .,0
7065,pecies with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle .,0
7066,"The haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes , because they produce gametes from specialized cells .",1
7067,"Meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case , because the organism that produces the gametes is already a haploid .",0
7068,"n 1866 , he published his work , Experiments in Plant Hybridization,1 in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn . Mendel ’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed , incorrectly , that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring ; this hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation .",0
7069,Continuous variation results from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height .,1
7070,Offspring appear to be a “ blend ” of their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation .,0
7071,"endel performed hybridizations , which involve mating two true - breeding individuals that have different traits .",1
7072,"In the pea , which is naturally self - pollinating , this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety .",0
7073,"nce Mendel examined the characteristics in the F1 generation of plants , he allowed them to self - fertilize naturally .",0
7074,"He then collected and grew the seeds from the F1 plants to produce the F2 , or second filial , generation .",0
7075,"Mendel ’s experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3 and F4 generations , and so on , but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P0−F1−F2 generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for Mendel ’s postulates . In one of his experiments on inheritance patterns , Mendel crossed plants that were true - breeding for violet flower color with plants true - breeding for white flower color ( the P generation ) .",0
7076,"e called these , respectively , dominant and recessive traits .",0
7077,Dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization .,1
7078,"Recessive traits become latent , or disappear , in the offspring of a hybridization .",1
7079,"n the other hand , the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway .",0
7080,"The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event , of two mutually exclusive events , is the sum of their individual probabilities .",1
7081,he observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype .,1
7082,"An organism ’s underlying genetic makeup , consisting of both physically visible and non - expressed alleles , is called its genotype .",1
7083,Mendel ’s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype .,0
7084,"hen fertilization occurs between two true - breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic , the process is called a monohybrid cross , and the resulting offspring are monohybrids .",1
7085,Mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic .,0
7086,"f course , doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical .",0
7087,"Instead , geneticists use pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases ( [ link ] ) .",0
7088,"lthough individual humans ( and all diploid organisms ) can only have two alleles for a given gene , multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed .",0
7089,"Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene , the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type ( often abbreviated “ + ” ) ; this is considered the standard or norm .",1
7090,"All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard , meaning that they deviate from the wild type .",0
7091,"lthough the Y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis , the Y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes .",0
7092,"When a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome , but not on the Y chromosome , it is said to be X - linked .",1
7093,"or instance , the recessive lethal Curly allele in Drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote . A single copy of the wild - type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival .",0
7094,The dominant lethal inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote ; this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age .,1
7095,Individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form .,0
7096,"endel ’s law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes , and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur .",1
7097,"The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross , a cross between two true - breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics .",0
7098,"n epistasis , the interaction between genes is antagonistic , such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another .",1
7099,“ Epistasis ” is a word composed of Greek roots that mean “ standing upon . ” The alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking .,0
7100,"f the genes are unlinked , the individual should produce AB , Ab , aB , and ab gametes with equal frequencies , according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment .",1
7101,"Because they correspond to new allele combinations , the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis .",1
7102,Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents .,1
7103,"uch a result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked , but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to occasionally occur .",0
7104,"Sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units , or centimorgans ( cM ) , in which a recombination frequency of 0.01 corresponds to 1 cM.By representing alleles in a linear map , Sturtevant suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked ( recombination frequency = 0 ) to being perfectly unlinked ( recombination frequency = 0.5 ) when genes are on different chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome .",1
7105,Perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the frequencies predicted by Mendel to assort independently in a dihybrid cross .,0
7106,"n a given species , chromosomes can be identified by their number , size , centromere position , and banding pattern .",0
7107,"In a human karyotype , autosomes or “ body chromosomes ” ( all of the non – sex chromosomes ) are generally organized in approximate order of size from largest ( chromosome 1 ) to smallest ( chromosome 22 ) .",1
7108,The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes .,0
7109,"n individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid ; in humans , euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes .",1
7110,"An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid , a term that includes monosomy ( loss of one chromosome ) or trisomy ( gain of an extraneous chromosome ) .",1
7111,"ather than a gain or loss of autosomes , variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects .",0
7112,"In part , this occurs because of a molecular process called X inactivation .",0
7113,"Early in development , when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells ( relative to trillions in the newborn ) , one X chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent ( dormant ) structure called a Barr body .",1
7114," translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different , nonhomologous chromosome .",1
7115,Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences .,0
7116,he origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site .,0
7117,An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs .,1
7118,ATP hydrolysis is required for this process .,0
7119,he problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end .,0
7120,"Another enzyme , RNA primase , synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA .",1
7121,"Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis , it is appropriately called the primer .",0
7122,his continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand .,0
7123,"The other strand , complementary to the 5 ' to 3 ' parental DNA , is extended away from the replication fork , in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments , each requiring a primer to start the synthesis .",1
7124,Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them .,0
7125,he sliding clamp is a ring - shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place .,1
7126,Topoisomerase prevents the over - winding of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up ; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it .,1
7127,"As synthesis proceeds , the RNA primers are replaced by DNA .",0
7128,"ome errors are not corrected during replication , but are instead corrected after replication is completed ; this type of repair is known as mismatch repair ( [ link ] ) .",1
7129,The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it ; this is then replaced by the correct base .,0
7130,uch mutations may be of two types : induced or spontaneous .,0
7131,"Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals , UV rays , x - rays , or some other environmental agent .",1
7132,Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent ; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body .,1
7133,ome mutations are not expressed ; these are known as silent mutations .,1
7134,Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair .,1
7135,"The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions , in which one base is replaced by another .",1
7136,"he ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres , which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene .",1
7137,"In a way , these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide .",0
7138,he translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence .,0
7139,"However , the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear , such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1 , nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2 , and so on . Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA .",0
7140,Ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein .,1
7141,hese nucleotide triplets are called codons .,1
7142,"The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame , thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid ( [ link ] ) .",0
7143,"Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation , the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained .",0
7144,lasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance . Transcription in prokaryotes ( and in eukaryotes ) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis .,0
7145,The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble .,1
7146,"Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene , which is called the template strand .",1
7147,"The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand , called the nontemplate strand .",1
7148,"he nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5 ' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the + 1 site , or the initiation site .",1
7149,Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream .,0
7150,"Conversely , nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “ + ” numbering and are called downstream nucleotides .",1
7151,"ithout σ , the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish .",0
7152,The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme .,1
7153,ne is protein - based and the other is RNA - based .,0
7154,"Rho - dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein , which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain .",1
7155,"Near the end of the gene , the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls .",0
7156,NA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus .,0
7157,"This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S pre - rRNA , transfer pre - RNAs ( pre - tRNAs ) , and small nuclear pre - RNAs .",0
7158,The tRNAs have a critical role in translation ; they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain .,0
7159,nhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed .,0
7160,Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation .,1
7161,"he corresponding amino acid must be added later , once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm .",0
7162,"Through the process of tRNA “ charging , ” each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases .",1
7163,At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids ; the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species .,0
7164,"any eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG , but this is not always the case .",0
7165,"According to Kozak ’s rules , the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon .",1
7166,Kozak ’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes : 5'-gccRccAUGG-3 ' .,0
7167,"sually , this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides .",0
7168,The cell performs an additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this .,0
7169,"ukaryotic genes are composed of exons , which correspond to protein - coding sequences ( ex - on signifies that they are expressed ) , and intervening sequences called introns ( int - ron denotes their intervening role ) , which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre - mRNA during processing .",1
7170,Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional proteins .,0
7171,ll cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA .,0
7172,The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein is called gene expression .,1
7173,"Whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi - cellular organism , each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed .",0
7174,"n prokaryotic cells , there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons : repressors , activators , and inducers .",0
7175,"Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus , whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus .",1
7176,"Finally , inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate .",1
7177,he five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon .,0
7178,Just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site .,0
7179,This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription .,1
7180,"ust as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules , there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a positive regulator to turn genes on and activate them .",0
7181,"For example , when glucose is scarce , E .",0
7182,ne such sugar source is lactose .,0
7183,The lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment .,1
7184,CAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon .,1
7185,"hen transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene , it is referred to as a cis - acting element , because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene .",1
7186,The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site .,1
7187,Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed .,0
7188,"he 5 ' cap , which is placed on the 5 ' end of the mRNA , is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule ( GTP ) .",1
7189,"The poly - A tail , which is attached to the 3 ' end , is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides .",1

7191,"ather , these are regions that regulate mRNA localization , stability , and protein translation .",0
7192,"The region just before the protein - coding region is called the 5 ' UTR , whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3 ' UTR ( [ link ] ) .",1
7193,"The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule , depending on the specific RBP that binds .",0
7194,hese pre - miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called dicer .,0
7195,"Like transcription factors and RBPs , mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA ; however , miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) .",1
7196,RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade the target mRNA .,0
7197,he first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 ( eIF-2 ) .,1
7198,The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high - energy molecule guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) .,0
7199,GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) .,0
7200,"t this point , when the initiator complex is assembled , the GTP is converted into GDP and energy is released .",0
7201,The phosphate and the eIF-2 protein are released from the complex and the large 60S ribosomal subunit binds to translate the RNA .,0
7202,The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation .,0
7203,n example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc .,0
7204,"Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in Burkett ’s Lymphoma , a cancer of the lymph system .",1
7205,Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably .,0
7206,ells are broken using a lysis buffer ( a solution which is mostly a detergent ) ; lysis means “ to split . ” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes .,1

7213,"In the bacterial context , the fragment of DNA from the human genome ( or the genome of another organism that is being studied ) is referred to as foreign DNA , or a transgene , to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium , which is called the host DNA .",1
7214,he MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases .,0
7215,Restriction endonucleases recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner ; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA .,1
7216,"Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA , such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single - stranded overhang .",0
7217,"nicellular organisms , such as bacteria and yeast , naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission ; this is known as cellular cloning .",1
7218,"The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis , which creates an exact replica of the genetic material .",0
7219,he addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering .,0
7220,The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism ( GMO ) .,1
7221,"If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species , the host organism is called transgenic .",1
7222,he process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing .,1

7224,"enomics is the study of entire genomes , including the complete set of genes , their nucleotide sequence and organization , and their interactions within a species and with other species .",1
7225,Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome .,1
7226,enetic maps provide the big picture ( similar to a map of interstate highways ) and use genetic markers ( similar to landmarks ) .,0
7227,A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co - segregates ( shows genetic linkage ) with a specific trait .,1
7228,Early geneticists called this linkage analysis .,0
7229,"or example , in experiments performed on the garden pea , it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plant ’s pollen were linked traits , and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome .",0
7230,"The exchange of DNA between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic recombination , which occurs by the crossing over of DNA between homologous strands of DNA , such as nonsister chromatids .",1
7231,Linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes .,1
7232,"t is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping , but not the exact distance ( number of base pairs ) .",0
7233,"Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation , such as x - rays , to break the DNA into fragments .",1
7234,The amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments .,0
7235," genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology ( a sequence - tagged site , or STS ) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location .",0
7236,An expressed sequence tag ( EST ) and a single sequence length polymorphism ( SSLP ) are common STSs .,0
7237,A person ’s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual .,0
7238,"Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( [ link ] ) .",1
7239,( a ) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material ( DNA ) inherited from one ’s parents .,1
7240,"( b ) Phenotype describes an individual ’s observable characteristics , such as hair color , skin color , height , and build .",0
7241,"In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b. ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele .",1
7242,"When someone has two copies of the same allele , they are said to be homozygous for that allele .",1
7243,"When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be heterozygous .",1
7244,( a ) A Punnett square is a tool used to predict how genes will interact in the production of offspring .,1
7245,"The capital B represents the dominant allele , and the lowercase b represents the recessive allele .",0
7246,Most traits are polygenic : controlled by more than one gene .,1
7247,"Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . In this Punnett square , N represents the normal allele , and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PKU .",0

7250,"Neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system , 100 billion strong at birth .",1
7251,"Like all cells , neurons consist of several different parts , each serving a specialized function ( [ link ] ) .",0
7252,"The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma , or cell body .",1
7253,The soma has branching extensions known as dendrites .,0
7254,"The neuron is a small information processor , and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons .",1
7255,Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet .,0
7256,"In some axons , glial cells form a fatty substance known as the myelin sheath , which coats the axon and acts as an insulator , increasing the speed at which the signal travels .",1
7257,The myelin sheath is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system : the loss of the insulation it provides can be detrimental to normal function .,0
7258,We begin at the neuronal membrane .,0
7259,"The neuron exists in a fluid environment — it is surrounded by extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid ( i.e. , cytoplasm ) .",1
7260,The neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate — a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different .,0
7261,The action potential is an all - or - none phenomenon .,0
7262,"In simple terms , this means that an incoming signal from another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation .",1
7263,"There are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons , and we can speak in broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters ( [ link ] ) .",0
7264,Much of what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in psychological disorders .,0
7265,Psychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system .,1
7266,"Agonists are chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and , thus , strengthen its effects .",1
7267,"An antagonist , on the other hand , blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor .",1
7268,The somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary .,1
7269,"It is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS ; therefore , it consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons .",0
7270,"The two systems have complementary functions , operating in tandem to maintain the body ’s homeostasis .",0
7271,"Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium , in which biological conditions ( such as body temperature ) are maintained at optimal levels .",1
7272,The Spinal CordIt can be said that the spinal cord is what connects the brain to the outside world .,1
7273,"Because of it , the brain can act .",0
7274,"There is evidence of some specialization of function — referred to as lateralization — in each hemisphere , mainly regarding differences in language ability .",1
7275,"Beyond that , however , the differences that have been found have been minor .",0
7276,"Lobes of the BrainThe four lobes of the brain are the frontal , parietal , temporal , and occipital lobes ( [ link ] ) .",1
7277,"The frontal lobe is located in the forward part of the brain , extending back to a fissure known as the central sulcus .",1
7278,"The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning , motor control , emotion , and language .",0
7279,Gage 's case occurred in the midst of a 19th century debate over localization — regarding whether certain areas of the brain are associated with particular functions .,1
7280,"On the basis of extremely limited information about Gage , the extent of his injury , and his life before and after the accident , scientists tended to find support for their own views , on whichever side of the debate they fell ( Macmillan , 1999 ) .",0
7281,( a ) Phineas Gage holds the iron rod that penetrated his skull in an 1848 railroad construction accident .,0
7282,( b ) Gage ’s prefrontal cortex was severely damaged in the left hemisphere .,0
7283,"The temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the temples ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language .",1
7284,"The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .",1
7285,"The occipital lobe is located at the very back of the brain , and contains the primary visual cortex , which is responsible for interpreting incoming visual information .",1
7286,"The occipital cortex is organized retinotopically , which means there is a close relationship between the position of an object in a person ’s visual field and the position of that object ’s representation on the cortex .",1
7287,The limbic system is involved in processing both emotion and memory .,1
7288,"Interestingly , the sense of smell projects directly to the limbic system ; therefore , not surprisingly , smell can evoke emotional responses in ways that other sensory modalities can not .",0
7289,The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories .,1
7290,"The hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes , including the regulation of body temperature , appetite , and blood pressure .",1
7291,The hypothalamus also serves as an interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system and in the regulation of sexual motivation and behavior .,0
7292,"Midbrain and Hindbrain StructuresThe midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain , between the forebrain and the hindbrain .",1
7293,"The reticular formation is centered in the midbrain , but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain .",1
7294,"The reticular formation is important in regulating the sleep / wake cycle , arousal , alertness , and motor activity .",0
7295,"It contains the medulla , pons , and cerebellum ( [ link ] ) .",0
7296,"The medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system , such as breathing , blood pressure , and heart rate .",1
7297,"The word pons literally means “ bridge , ” and as the name suggests , the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord .",1
7298,"On February 25 , 1990 , a Florida woman named Terri Schiavo went into cardiac arrest , apparently triggered by a bulimic episode .",0

7300,"Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scans create pictures of the living , active brain ( [ link ] ) .",1
7301,"An individual receiving a PET scan drinks or is injected with a mildly radioactive substance , called a tracer .",1
7302,"In some situations , it is helpful to gain an understanding of the overall activity of a person ’s brain , without needing information on the actual location of the activity .",0
7303,Electroencephalography ( EEG ) serves this purpose by providing a measure of a brain ’s electrical activity .,1
7304,An array of electrodes is placed around a person ’s head ( [ link ] ) .,0
7305,"Located in the neck , the thyroid gland releases hormones that regulate growth , metabolism , and appetite .",1
7306,"In hyperthyroidism , or Grave ’s disease , the thyroid secretes too much of the hormone thyroxine , causing agitation , bulging eyes , and weight loss .",1
7307,These pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( glucagon ) .,0
7308,"People who suffer from diabetes do not produce enough insulin ; therefore , they must take medications that stimulate or replace insulin production , and they must closely control the amount of sugars and carbohydrates they consume . The gonads secrete sexual hormones , which are important in reproduction , and mediate both sexual motivation and behavior .",1
7309,The female gonads are the ovaries ; the male gonads are the testes .,1
7310,"Visit this website to see an example of a consent form . While the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will be doing , sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants’ knowledge of the exact research question from affecting the results of the study .",0
7311,"Deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants in order to maintain the integrity of the experiment , but not to the point where the deception could be considered harmful .",1
7312,"For example , if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire , we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants’ responses .",0
7313,Many psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects .,0
7314,"Often , these researchers use rodents ( [ link ] ) or birds as the subjects of their experiments — the APA estimates that 90 % of all animal research in psychology uses these species ( American Psychological Association , n.d . ) .",0
7315,"Because many basic processes in animals are sufficiently similar to those in humans , these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that would be considered unethical in human participants .",1
7316,We can measure correlation by calculating a statistic known as a correlation coefficient .,0
7317,A correlation coefficient is a number from -1 to + 1 that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables .,1
7318,The correlation coefficient is usually represented by the letter r .,0
7319,Correlational research is useful because it allows us to discover the strength and direction of relationships that exist between two variables .,1
7320,"However , correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about cause and effect .",1
7321,"While variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other , it could also be that some other factor , a confounding variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest .",0
7322,"We also tend to make the mistake of illusory correlations , especially with unsystematic observations .",0
7323,"Illusory correlations , or false correlations , occur when people believe that relationships exist between two things when no such relationship exists .",1
7324,One well - known illusory correlation is the supposed effect that the moon ’s phases have on human behavior .,0
7325,"In order to conduct an experiment , a researcher must have a specific hypothesis to be tested .",0
7326,"As you ’ve learned , hypotheses can be formulated either through direct observation of the real world or after careful review of previous research .",1
7327,"Ideally , the people who observe and record the children ’s behavior are unaware of who was assigned to the experimental or control group , in order to control for experimenter bias .",0
7328,Experimenter bias refers to the possibility that a researcher ’s expectations might skew the results of the study .,1
7329,"Remember , conducting an experiment requires a lot of planning , and the people involved in the research project have a vested interest in supporting their hypotheses .",0
7330,"Because by doing so , we can control for both experimenter and participant expectations .",0
7331,"If you are familiar with the phrase placebo effect , you already have some idea as to why this is an important consideration .",0
7332,The placebo effect occurs when people 's expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in a given situation .,1
7333,Our study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include .,0
7334,"Participants are the subjects of psychological research , and as the name implies , individuals who are involved in psychological research actively participate in the process .",1
7335,"Often , psychological research projects rely on college students to serve as participants .",0
7336,Random assignment is critical for sound experimental design .,0
7337,"With sufficiently large samples , random assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups .",1
7338,"Poorly conceived or executed studies can be weeded out , and even well - designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested .",0
7339,"Peer review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it , meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability .",1
7340,Sometimes replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding .,0
7341,"In observational research , scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person or just a few individuals .",1
7342,"Indeed , some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10–20 individuals .",0
7343,The information provided by these studies is invaluable in understanding how those animals organize socially and communicate with one another .,0
7344,"The anthropologist Jane Goodall , for example , spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of chimpanzees in Africa ( [ link ] ) .",0
7345,"As an illustration of the types of concerns that a researcher might encounter in naturalistic observation , some scientists criticized Goodall for giving the chimps names instead of referring to them by numbers — using names was thought to undermine the emotional detachment required for the objectivity of the study ( McKie , 2010 ) .",0
7346,"To protect against this type of bias , researchers should have clear criteria established for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified .",0
7347,"In addition , researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple observers , in order to test inter - rater reliability : a measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different observers .",1
7348,"Instead , they use existing records to answer various research questions .",0
7349,This type of research approach is known as archival research .,0
7350,Archival research relies on looking at past records or data sets to look for interesting patterns or relationships .,1
7351,"Even without significant life changes , some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation in the project .",0
7352,"As a result , the attrition rates , or reduction in the number of research participants due to dropouts , in longitudinal studies are quite high and increases over the course of a project .",1
7353,"For this reason , researchers using this approach typically recruit many participants fully expecting that a substantial number will drop out before the end .",0
7354,"In the end , research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions .",0
7355,"Facts are observable realities , and opinions are personal judgments , conclusions , or attitudes that may or may not be accurate .",1
7356,"In the scientific community , facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research . THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHScientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method .",0
7357,"We ’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas , but what sort of ideas are they , exactly ?",0
7358,A theory is a well - developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena .,1
7359,"Theories are repeatedly checked against the world , but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once ; instead , researchers create hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory .",0
7360,"A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable , or capable of being shown to be incorrect .",1
7361,Recall from the introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( [ link ] ) .,0
7362,"However , a major criticism of Freud ’s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable ; for example , it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the i d , the ego , and the superego — the three elements of personality described in Freud ’s theories .",0
7363,The scientific method is also a form of empiricism .,0
7364,"An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation , including experimentation , rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities .",1
7365,"In some areas in psychology , it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out positions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty .",0
7366,"In most cases , young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full - time faculty position .",0
7367,"As the name suggests , biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior .",1
7368,"While biological psychology is a broad field , many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function of the nervous system is related to behavior ( [ link ] ) .",0
7369,"As mentioned in the previous section , the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior .",1
7370,"Thus , cognitive psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions , or thoughts , and their relationship to our experiences and our actions .",1
7371,"Like biological psychology , cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds .",0
7372,Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique .,1
7373,"Several individuals ( e.g. , Freud and Maslow ) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of psychology , and the American psychologist Gordon Allport , contributed to early theories of personality .",0
7374,Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others .,1
7375,"Social psychologists conduct research on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain the behaviors of others , prejudice , and attraction , and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts .",1
7376,"Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological , psychological , and sociocultural factors .",1
7377,This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model ( [ link ] ) .,0
7378,Clinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic patterns of behavior .,1
7379,"As such , it is generally considered to be a more applied area within psychology ; however , some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research .",0
7380,Forensic psychology is a branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context of the justice system .,1
7381,"For example , forensic psychologists ( and forensic psychiatrists ) will assess a person ’s competency to stand trial , assess the state of mind of a defendant , act as consultants on child custody cases , consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations , and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony and children ’s testimony ( American Board of Forensic Psychology , 2014 ) .",0
7382,"These experimental requirements were put in place to eliminate “ interpretation ” in the reporting of internal experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is observing their mind or consciousness accurately , since it can not be seen by any other person .",0
7383,This attempt to understand the structure or characteristics of the mind was known as structuralism .,1
7384,Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 ( [ link ] ) .,0
7385,Perhaps one of the most influential and well - known figures in psychology ’s history was Sigmund Freud ( [ link ] ) .,0
7386,Freud ( 1856–1939 ) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “ hysteria ” and neurosis .,0
7387,Early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) .,0
7388,"Pavlov studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex , in which an animal or human produced a reflex ( unconscious ) response to a stimulus and , over time , was conditioned to produce the response to a different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus .",1
7389,Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior . B .,0
7390,F. Skinner ( 1904–1990 ) was an American psychologist ( [ link ] ) .,0
7391,"Like Watson , Skinner was a behaviorist , and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences .",0
7392,Abraham Maslow ( 1908–1970 ) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior ( [ link ] ) .,0
7393,"Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter , a brief overview will be provided here .",0
7394,Consciousness describes our awareness of internal and external stimuli .,1
7395,"Awareness of internal stimuli includes feeling pain , hunger , thirst , sleepiness , and being aware of our thoughts and emotions .",0
7396,Biological rhythms are internal rhythms of biological activity .,1
7397,"A woman ’s menstrual cycle is an example of a biological rhythm — a recurring , cyclical pattern of bodily changes .",0
7398,"In the brain , the hypothalamus , which lies above the pituitary gland , is a main center of homeostasis .",1
7399,"Homeostasis is the tendency to maintain a balance , or optimal level , within a biological system .",1
7400,One important regulator of sleep - wake cycles is the hormone melatonin .,1
7401,"The pineal gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin , is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep ( Hardeland , Pandi - Perumal , & Cardinali , 2006 ) .",1
7402,Melatonin release is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light .,1
7403,Jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment .,1
7404,"These symptoms include fatigue , sluggishness , irritability , and insomnia ( i.e. , a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month ’s time ) ( Roth , 2007 ) .",0
7405,"As we grow older , we sleep less .",0
7406,"In fact , a meta - analysis , which is a study that combines the results of many related studies , conducted within the last decade indicates that by the time we are 65 years old , we average fewer than 7 hours of sleep per day ( Ohayon , Carskadon , Guilleminault , & Vitiello , 2004 ) .",1
7407,"As the amount of time we sleep varies over our lifespan , presumably the sleep debt would adjust accordingly .",0
7408,Sleep can be divided into two different general phases : REM sleep and non - REM ( NREM ) sleep .,1
7409,Rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep is characterized by darting movements of the eyes under closed eyelids .,1
7410,Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness .,0
7411,"In terms of brain wave activity , stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves .",0
7412,"The early portion of stage 1 sleep produces alpha waves , which are relatively low frequency ( 8–13Hz ) , high amplitude patterns of electrical activity ( waves ) that become synchronized ( [ link ] ) .",1
7413,"This pattern of brain wave activity resembles that of someone who is very relaxed , yet awake .",0
7414,"Theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain , but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles ( [ link ] ) .",1
7415,"A sleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory ( Fogel & Smith , 2011 ; Poe , Walsh , & Bjorness , 2010 ) .",1
7416,"In addition , the appearance of K - complexes is often associated with stage 2 sleep .",0
7417,The meaning of dreams varies across different cultures and periods of time .,0
7418,"By the late 19th century , German psychiatrist Sigmund Freud had become convinced that dreams represented an opportunity to gain access to the unconscious .",0
7419,"By analyzing dreams , Freud thought people could increase self - awareness and gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives .",0
7420,The 20th century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious .,0
7421,"The collective unconscious , as described by Jung , is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone .",1
7422,"According to Jung , certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all people regardless of culture or location .",0
7423,"A parasomnia is one of a group of sleep disorders in which unwanted , disruptive motor activity and/or experiences during sleep play a role .",1
7424,Parasomnias can occur in either REM or NREM phases of sleep .,0
7425,A person with restless leg syndrome has uncomfortable sensations in the legs during periods of inactivity or when trying to fall asleep .,1
7426,"This discomfort is relieved by deliberately moving the legs , which , not surprisingly , contributes to difficulty in falling or staying asleep .",0
7427,There are two types of sleep apnea : obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea .,0
7428,"Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when an individual ’s airway becomes blocked during sleep , and air is prevented from entering the lungs .",1
7429,"In central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing ( White , 2005).One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep .",1
7430,SIDSIn sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) an infant stops breathing during sleep and dies .,1
7431,"Infants younger than 12 months appear to be at the highest risk for SIDS , and boys have a greater risk than girls .",0
7432,"The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM-5 ) is used by clinicians to diagnose individuals suffering from various psychological disorders .",1
7433,"Drug use disorders are addictive disorders , and the criteria for specific substance ( drug ) use disorders are described in DSM-5 .",0
7434,"In contrast , a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional , rather than physical , need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress .",1
7435,"Tolerance is linked to physiological dependence , and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses .",1
7436,Tolerance can cause the user to increase the amount of drug used to a dangerous level — even to the point of overdose and death .,0
7437,Stimulants are drugs that tend to increase overall levels of neural activity .,1
7438,Many of these drugs act as agonists of the dopamine neurotransmitter system .,0
7439,"While caffeine is generally considered a relatively safe drug , high blood levels of caffeine can result in insomnia , agitation , muscle twitching , nausea , irregular heartbeat , and even death ( Reissig , Strain , & Griffiths , 2009 ; Wolt , Ganetsky , & Babu , 2012 ) .",0
7440,"In 2012 , Kromann and Nielson reported on a case study of a 40-year - old woman who suffered significant ill effects from her use of caffeine .",0
7441,"Thus , opioid drugs , which mimic this endogenous painkilling mechanism , have an extremely high potential for abuse .",0
7442,"Natural opioids , called opiates , are derivatives of opium , which is a naturally occurring compound found in the poppy plant .",1
7443,"There are now several synthetic versions of opiate drugs ( correctly called opioids ) that have very potent painkilling effects , and they are often abused .",1
7444,Codeine is an opioid with relatively low potency .,1
7445,"It is often prescribed for minor pain , and it is available over - the - counter in some other countries .",0
7446,Meditation is the act of focusing on a single target ( such as the breath or a repeated sound ) to increase awareness of the moment .,1
7447,"While hypnosis is generally achieved through the interaction of a therapist and the person being treated , an individual can perform meditation alone .",1
7448,The sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold .,0
7449,Absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be detected 50 % of the time .,1
7450,Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft can a sound be and still be detected half of the time .,0
7451,"While our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment , it is ultimately how we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world .",0
7452,"Perception refers to the way sensory information is organized , interpreted , and consciously experienced .",1
7453,Perception involves both bottom - up and top - down processing .,0
7454,"In fact , we often do n’t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time .",1
7455,This is known as sensory adaptation .,0
7456,Imagine entering a classroom with an old analog clock .,0
7457,The shared experiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception .,0
7458,"For example , Marshall Segall , Donald Campbell , and Melville Herskovits ( 1963 ) published the results of a multinational study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non - Western cultures , and vice versa .",0
7459,"One such illusion that Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller - Lyer illusion ( [ link ] ) : The lines appear to be different lengths , but they are actually the same length .",1
7460,The amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave ( peak or crest ) to the lowest point on the wave ( trough ) .,1
7461,Wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next .,1
7462,"Like light waves , the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception of sound .",0
7463,The frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound ’s pitch .,1
7464,"High - frequency sound waves are perceived as high - pitched sounds , while low - frequency sound waves are perceived as low - pitched sounds .",1
7465,The eye is the major sensory organ involved in vision ( [ link ] ) .,1
7466,Light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil .,1
7467,"When light levels are high , the pupil will constrict , or become smaller , to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye .",1
7468,"The pupil ’s size is controlled by muscles that are connected to the iris , which is the colored portion of the eye .",0
7469,The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells ( [ link ] ) .,1
7470,"These photoreceptor cells , known as cones , are light - detecting cells .",1
7471,The cones are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions .,0
7472,Rods and cones are connected ( via several interneurons ) to retinal ganglion cells .,0
7473,Axons from the retinal ganglion cells converge and exit through the back of the eye to form the optic nerve .,1
7474,The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain .,1
7475,Normal - sighted individuals have three different types of cones that mediate color vision .,0
7476,Each of these cone types is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light .,0
7477,Another implication is that this leads to the experience of negative afterimages .,0
7478,An afterimage describes the continuation of a visual sensation after removal of the stimulus .,1
7479,This outcome suggests that technology has created new avenues for obscene material to be disseminated .,0
7480,"The Children ’s Internet Protection Act , however , requires K–12 schools and public libraries receiving Internet access using special E - rate discounts to filter or block access to obscene material and other material deemed harmful to minors , with certain exceptions .",1
7481,There has been increased conflict over the Second Amendment in recent years due to school shootings and gun violence .,0
7482,"As a result , gun rights have become a highly charged political issue .",0
7483,The Third Amendment says in full :,0
7484,"Furthermore , the courts have found that police do not generally need a warrant to search the passenger compartment of a car ( [ link ] ) , or to search people entering the United States from another country . See , for example , Arizona v. Gant , 556 U.S. 332 ( 2009 ) .",0
7485,"When a warrant is needed , law enforcement officers do not need enough evidence to secure a conviction , but they must demonstrate to a judge that there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or evidence will be found .",1
7486,Probable cause is the legal standard for determining whether a search or seizure is constitutional or a crime has been committed ; it is a lower threshold than the standard of proof at a criminal trial .,0
7487,"Many of the provisions dealing with the rights of the accused are included in the Fifth Amendment ; accordingly , it is one of the longest in the Bill of Rights .",0
7488,The Fifth Amendment states in full :,0
7489,"Perhaps the most famous provision of the Fifth Amendment is its protection against self - incrimination , or the right to remain silent .",1
7490,This provision is so well known that we have a phrase for it : “ taking the Fifth . ” People have the right not to give evidence in court or to law enforcement officers that might constitute an admission of guilt or responsibility for a crime .,0
7491,The greatest recent controversy over economic liberty has been sparked by cities’ and states’ use of the power of eminent domain to take property for redevelopment .,0
7492,"Traditionally , the main use of eminent domain was to obtain property for transportation corridors like railroads , highways , canals and reservoirs , and pipelines , which require fairly straight routes to be efficient .",0
7493,Most people accused of crimes decline their right to a jury trial .,0
7494,"This choice is typically the result of a plea bargain , an agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor in which the defendant pleads guilty to the charge(s ) in question , or perhaps to less serious charges , in exchange for more lenient punishment than he or she might receive if convicted after a full trial .",1
7495,There are a number of reasons why this might happen .,0
7496,"The Eighth Amendment says , in full :",0
7497,The Tenth Amendment is as follows :,0
7498,"Although several state constitutions do list the right to privacy as a protected right , the explicit recognition by the Supreme Court of a right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution emerged only in the middle of the twentieth century .",0
7499,"In 1965 , the court spelled out the right to privacy for the first time in Griswold v. Connecticut , a case that struck down a state law forbidding even married individuals to use any form of contraception . Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 ( 1965 ) Although many subsequent cases before the Supreme Court also dealt with privacy in the course of intimate , sexual conduct , the issue of privacy matters as well in the context of surveillance and monitoring by government and private parties of our activities , movements , and communications .",1
7500,Both these senses of privacy are examined below .,0
7501,"Beyond the issues of contraception and abortion , the right to privacy has been interpreted to encompass a more general right for adults to have noncommercial , consensual sexual relationships in private .",0
7502,"However , this legal development is relatively new ; as recently as 1986 , the Supreme Court ruled that states could still criminalize sex acts between two people of the same sex . Bowers v. Hardwick , 478 U.S. 186 ( 1986 ) .",1
7503,"That decision was overturned in 2003 in Lawrence v. Texas , which invalidated state laws that criminalized sodomy . Lawrence v. Texas , 539 U.S. 558 ( 2003 ) .",1
7504,"The proclamation that “ all men are created equal ” appears in the Declaration of Independence , and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that the federal government treat people equally .",0
7505,"According to Chief Justice Earl Warren in the Supreme Court case of Bolling v. Sharpe ( 1954 ) , “ discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.”Bolling v. Sharpe , 347 U.S. 497 ( 1954 ) .",0
7506,"Additional guarantees of equality are provided by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , ratified in 1868 , which states in part that “ No State shall .",0
7507,.,0
7508,Discrimination based on gender or sex is generally examined with intermediate scrutiny .,0
7509,"The standard of intermediate scrutiny was first applied by the Supreme Court in Craig v. Boren ( 1976 ) and again in Clark v. Jeter ( 1988).Craig v. Boren , 429 U.S. 190 ( 1976 ) ; Clark v. Jeter , 486 U.S. 456 ( 1988 ) .",0
7510,"It requires the government to demonstrate that treating men and women differently is “ substantially related to an important governmental objective . ” This puts the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate why the unequal treatment is justifiable , not on the individual who alleges unfair discrimination has taken place .",1
7511,"Clearly , then , new civil rights issues can emerge over time .",0
7512,"How can we , as citizens , identify them as they emerge and distinguish genuine claims of discrimination from claims by those who have merely been unable to convince a majority to agree with their viewpoints ?",0
7513,"The spread of slavery into the West seemed inevitable , however , following the Supreme Court ’s ruling in the case Dred Scott v. Sandford , Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1857 ) .",0
7514,decided in 1857 .,0
7515,"Scott , who had been born into slavery but had spent time in free states and territories , argued that his temporary residence in a territory where slavery had been banned by the federal government had made him a free man .",0
7516,"New York : Harper & Row , 45 .",0
7517,"Although at the beginning of the war President Abraham Lincoln had been willing to allow slavery to continue in the South to preserve the Union , he changed his policies regarding abolition over the course of the war .",0
7518,"The first step was the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1 , 1863 ( [ link ] ) .",0
7519,Although it stated “ all persons held as slaves .,0
7520,The changes wrought by the Fourteenth Amendment were more extensive .,0
7521,"In addition to introducing the equal protection clause to the Constitution , this amendment also extended the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the states , required the states to respect the privileges or immunities of all citizens , and , for the first time , defined citizenship at the national and state levels .",1
7522,Perhaps the most famous of the tools of disenfranchisement were literacy tests and understanding tests .,0
7523,"Literacy tests , which had been used in the North since the 1850s to disqualify naturalized European immigrants from voting , called on the prospective voter to demonstrate his ( and later her ) ability to read a particular passage of text .",1
7524,W. E. B .,0
7525,"Du Bois , however , argued for a more confrontational approach and in 1909 founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) as a rallying point for securing equality .",0
7526,"Liberal whites dominated the organization in its early years , but African Americans assumed control over its operations in the 1920s.“NAACP : 100 Years of History , ” https://donate.naacp.org/pages/naacp-history ( April 10 , 2016 ) .",0
7527,"A few months later , in Little Rock , Arkansas , governor Orval Faubus resisted court - ordered integration and mobilized National Guard troops to keep black students out of Central High School .",0
7528,"President Eisenhower then called up the Arkansas National Guard for federal duty ( essentially taking the troops out of Faubus ’s hands ) and sent soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division to escort students to and from classes , as shown in [ link ] .",0

Kraemer ( 1948 ) , the Supreme Court held that while such covenants did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because they consisted of agreements between private citizens , their provisions could not be enforced by courts . Shelley v. Kraemer , 334 U.S. 1 ( 1948 ) .",1
7532,"Because state courts are government institutions and the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the government from denying people equal protection of the law , the courts’ enforcement of such covenants would be a violation of the amendment .",0
7533,"Thus , if a white family chose to sell its house to a black family and the other homeowners in the neighborhood tried to sue the seller , the court would not hear the case .",0
7534,"These newer groups tended to prefer more confrontational approaches , including the use of direct action campaigns relying on marches and demonstrations .",0
7535,"The strategies of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience , or the refusal to obey an unjust law , had been effective in the campaign led by Mahatma Gandhi to liberate colonial India from British rule in the 1930s and 1940s .",0
7536,Civil rights pioneers adopted these measures in the 1955–1956 Montgomery bus boycott .,0
7537,"Not only did the act outlaw government discrimination and the unequal application of voting qualifications by race , but it also , for the first time , outlawed segregation and other forms of discrimination by most businesses that were open to the public , including hotels , theaters , and restaurants that were not private clubs .",0
7538,"It outlawed discrimination on the basis of race , ethnicity , religion , sex , or national origin by most employers , and it created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) to monitor employment discrimination claims and help enforce this provision of the law .",1
7539,"The provisions that affected private businesses and employers were legally justified not by the Fourteenth Amendment ’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws but instead by Congress ’s power to regulate interstate commerce . See Heart of Atlanta Motel , Inc. v. United States , 379 U.S. 241 ( 1964 ) ; Katzenbach v. McClung , 379 U.S. 294 ( 1964 ) , which built on Wickard v. Filburn , 317 U.S. 111 ( 1942 ) .",0

7545,"Attempts to integrate public schools through the use of busing — transporting students from one segregated neighborhood to another to achieve more racially balanced schools — were particularly unpopular and helped contribute to “ white flight ” from cities to the suburbs . Sokol , 175–177 .",1
7546,"This white flight has created de facto segregation , a form of segregation that results from the choices of individuals to live in segregated communities without government action or support .",1
7547,"Because affirmative action attempts to redress discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity , it is generally subject to the strict scrutiny standard , which means the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate the necessity of racial discrimination to achieve a compelling governmental interest .",0
7548,"In 1978 , in Bakke v. California , the Supreme Court upheld affirmative action and said that colleges and universities could consider race when deciding whom to admit but could not establish racial quotas . Bakke v. California , 438 U.S. 265 ( 1978 ) .",1
7549,"In 2003 , the Supreme Court reaffirmed the Bakke decision in Grutter v. Bollinger , which said that taking race or ethnicity into account as one of several factors in admitting a student to a college or university was acceptable , but a system setting aside seats for a specific quota of minority students was not .",1

7693,A caucus is a meeting of party members in which nominees are selected informally .,1
7694,"Caucuses are less expensive than primaries because they rely on voting methods such as dropping marbles in a jar , placing names in a hat , standing under a sign bearing the candidate ’s name , or taking a voice vote .",0
7695,"Add to this that primary and caucus voters are often more extreme in their political beliefs , and it is easy to see why fewer moderates become party nominees .",0

7725,Why did the group risk alienating Democratic voters by preventing Sanders from speaking ?,0
7726,"Because Black Lives Matter had been trying to raise awareness of the treatment of black citizens in the United States , and the media has the power to elevate such issues.http://blacklivesmatter.com/about/ ( August 29 , 2015 ) .",1

7728,"The media also engages in agenda setting , which is the act of choosing which issues or topics deserve public discussion .",1

7731,"The publication of the Federalist Papers , as well as the Anti - Federalist Papers , in the 1780s , moved the nation into the party press era , in which partisanship and political party loyalty dominated the choice of editorial content .",0
7732,One reason was cost .,0
7733,"In 1896 , Adolph Ochs purchased the New York Times with the goal of creating a dignified newspaper that would provide readers with important news about the economy , politics , and the world rather than gossip and comics .",1
7734,"Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity , having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building , “ I know it when I see it . ” Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone .",0
7735,"In 1973 , the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene : “ ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value.”Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15 ( 1973 ) .",1
7736,"However , the application of this standard has at times been problematic .",0
7737,"In particular , the concept of “ contemporary community standards ” raises the possibility that obscenity varies from place to place ; many people in New York or San Francisco might not bat an eye at something people in Memphis or Salt Lake City would consider offensive .",0
7738,Free expression includes the right to assemble peaceably and the right to petition government officials .,0
7739,"This right even extends to members of groups whose views most people find abhorrent , such as American Nazis and the vehemently anti - gay Westboro Baptist Church , whose members have become known for their protests at the funerals of U.S. soldiers who have died fighting in the war on terror ( [ link]).National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie , 432 U.S. 43 ( 1977 ) ; Snyder v. Phelps , 562 U.S. 443 ( 2011 ) .",0
7740,Free expression — although a broad right — is subject to certain constraints to balance it against the interests of public order .,0
7741,"In particular , the nature , place , and timing of protests — but not their substantive content — are subject to reasonable limits .",0
7742,"In the meantime , as part of their black codes designed to reintroduce most of the trappings of slavery , several southern states adopted laws that restricted the carrying and ownership of weapons by former slaves .",0

7746,"Two years later , in McDonald v. Chicago , the Supreme Court overturned the Cruickshank decision ( 5–4 ) and again found that the right to bear arms was a fundamental right incorporated against the states , meaning that state regulation of firearms might , in some circumstances , be unconstitutional .",1
7747,"In 2015 , however , the Supreme Court allowed several of San Francisco ’s strict gun control laws to remain in place , suggesting that — as in the case of rights protected by the First Amendment — the courts will not treat gun rights as absolute ( [ link]).Richard Gonzales , “ Supreme Court Rejects NRA Challenge to San Francisco Gun Rules , ” National Public Radio , 8 June 2015 . http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/08/412917394/supreme-court-rejects-nra-challenge-to-s-f-gun-rules ( March 4 , 2016 ) .",0
7748,"In either case , the amendment indicates that government officials are required to apply for and receive a search warrant prior to a search or seizure ; this warrant is a legal document , signed by a judge , allowing police to search and/or seize persons or property .",0
7749,"Since the 1960s , however , the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings limiting the warrant requirement in situations where a person can be said to lack a “ reasonable expectation of privacy ” outside the home .",0
7750,"In addition to protecting the personal freedoms of individuals , the Bill of Rights protects those suspected or accused of crimes from various forms of unfair or unjust treatment .",0
7751,The prominence of these protections in the Bill of Rights may seem surprising .,0
7752,"The most notable is that it prohibits a second prosecution only at the same level of government ( federal or state ) as the first ; the federal government can try you for violating federal law , even if a state or local court finds you not guilty of the same action .",0

7754,The final provision of the Fifth Amendment has little to do with crime at all .,0
7755,"The takings clause says that “ private property [ can not ] be taken for public use , without just compensation . ” This provision , along with the due process clause ’s provisions limiting the taking of property , can be viewed as a protection of individuals’ economic liberty : their right to obtain , use , and trade tangible and intangible property for their own benefit .",0
7756,"For example , you have the right to trade your knowledge , skills , and labor for money through work or the use of your property , or trade money or goods for other things of value , such as clothing , housing , education , or food .",0

7759,"The Seventh Amendment deals with the rights of those engaged in civil disputes ; as noted earlier , these are disagreements between individuals or businesses in which people are typically seeking compensation for some harm caused .",1
7760,"For example , in an automobile accident , the person responsible is compelled to compensate any others ( either directly or through his or her insurance company ) .",0
7761,"At the same time , however , it appears that the public mood may have shifted somewhat against the death penalty , perhaps due in part to an overall decline in violent crime .",0

7766,"It remains to be seen whether this gradual trend toward the elimination of the death penalty by the states will continue , or whether the Supreme Court will eventually decide to follow former Justice Harry Blackmun ’s decision to “ no longer … tinker with the machinery of death ” and abolish it completely .",0
7767,We saw above that James Madison and the other framers were aware they might endanger some rights if they listed a few in the Constitution and omitted others .,0
7768,"To ensure that those interpreting the Constitution would recognize that the listing of freedoms and rights in the Bill of Rights was not exhaustive , the Ninth Amendment states :",0
7769,"Although the term privacy does not appear in the Constitution or Bill of Rights , scholars have interpreted several Bill of Rights provisions as an indication that James Madison and Congress sought to protect a common - law right to privacy as it would have been understood in the late eighteenth century : a right to be free of government intrusion into our personal life , particularly within the bounds of the home .",1
7770,"For example , we could perhaps see the Second Amendment as standing for the common - law right to self - defense in the home ; the Third Amendment as a statement that government soldiers should not be housed in anyone ’s home ; the Fourth Amendment as setting a high legal standard for allowing agents of the state to intrude on someone ’s home ; and the due process and takings clauses of the Fifth Amendment as applying an equally high legal standard to the government ’s taking a home or property ( reinforced after the Civil War by the Fourteenth Amendment ) .",0
7771,"Starting in the 1980s , Supreme Court justices appointed by Republican presidents began to roll back the Roe decision .",0
7772,"A key turning point was the court ’s ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992 , in which a plurality of the court rejected Roe ’s framework based on trimesters of pregnancy and replaced it with the undue burden test , which allows restrictions prior to viability that are not “ substantial obstacle[s ] ” ( undue burdens ) to women seeking an abortion . Planned Parenthood v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833 ( 1992 ) .",1
7773,"Thus , the court upheld some state restrictions , including a required waiting period between arranging and having an abortion , parental consent ( or , if not possible for some reason such as incest , authorization of a judge ) for minors , and the requirement that women be informed of the health consequences of having an abortion .",0
7774,Other restrictions such as a requirement that a married woman notify her spouse prior to an abortion were struck down as an undue burden .,0
7775,"In the United States , many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act ( i.e. , Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ) , passed weeks after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 , have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or , in some cases , to bypass warrant requirements altogether .",0
7776,"Critics have argued that the Patriot Act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals , in particular drug dealers , rather than terrorists as intended .",0
7777,"Most European countries , at least on paper , have opted for laws that protect against such government surveillance , perhaps mindful of past experience with communist and fascist regimes .",0
7778,"Unless the person or group challenging the law can prove otherwise , the courts will generally decide the discriminatory practice is allowed .",0
7779,"In these cases , the courts are applying the rational basis test .",0

7781,"Discrimination against members of racial , ethnic , or religious groups or those of various national origins is reviewed to the greatest degree by the courts , which apply the strict scrutiny standard in these cases .",0
7782,"Under strict scrutiny , the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate that there is a compelling governmental interest in treating people from one group differently from those who are not part of that group — the law or action can be “ narrowly tailored ” to achieve the goal in question , and that it is the “ least restrictive means ” available to achieve that goal . Johnson v. California , 543 U.S. 499 ( 2005 ) .",0

7936,The varied registration and voting laws across the United States have long caused controversy .,0
7937,"In the aftermath of the Civil War , southern states enacted literacy tests , grandfather clauses , and other requirements intended to disenfranchise black voters in Alabama , Georgia , and Mississippi .",0
7938,"Literacy tests were long and detailed exams on local and national politics , history , and more .",1
7939,States found to violate provisions of the VRA were required to get any changes in their election laws approved by the U.S. attorney general or by going through the court system .,0
7940,"However , in Shelby County v. Holder ( 2013 ) , the Supreme Court , in a 5–4 decision , threw out the standards and process of the VRA , effectively gutting the landmark legislation . Shelby County v. Holder , 570 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2013 ) .",0
7941,This decision effectively pushed decision - making and discretion for election policy in VRA states to the state and local level .,0
7942,Several such states subsequently made changes to their voter ID laws and North Carolina changed its plans for how many polling places were available in certain areas .,0
7943,Some attempts have been made to streamline voter registration .,0
7944,"The National Voter Registration Act ( 1993 ) , often referred to as Motor Voter , was enacted to expedite the registration process and make it as simple as possible for voters .",0

7950,The simple act of moving away to college presents a voter registration problem .,0
7951,Elections are local .,0
7952,We can count subsections of this population to calculate voter turnout .,0
7953,"For instance , the next largest population in the country is the voting - age population ( VAP ) , which consists of persons who are eighteen and older .",1
7954,"Some of these persons may not be eligible to vote in their state , but they are included because they are of age to do so . Michael P. McDonald and Samuel Popkin .",0
7955,"Due to consistently low turnout among the young , several organizations have made special efforts to demonstrate to younger citizens that voting is an important activity .",0
7956,"Rock the Vote began in 1990 , with the goal of bringing music , art , and pop culture together to encourage the youth to participate in government .",1
7957,"The organization hosts rallies , festivals , and concerts that also register voters and promote voter awareness , bringing celebrities and musicians to set examples of civic involvement .",0
7958,"A citizen ’s socioeconomic status — the combination of education , income , and social status — may also predict whether he or she will vote .",1
7959,"Among those who have completed college , the 2012 voter turnout rate jumps to 75 percent of eligible voters , compared to about 52.6 percent for those who have completed only high school.“Table 5 .",0

7964,"In Shelby County v. Holder ( 2013 ) , the Supreme Court agreed .",0
7965,"In a 5–4 decision , the justices in the majority said the formula for placing states on the VRA preclearance list was outdated and reached into the states’ authority to oversee elections . Shelby County v. Holder , 570 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2013 ) .",0
7966,"States and counties on the preclearance list were released , and Congress was told to design new guidelines for placing states on the list .",0
7967,"Finally , some voters may view non - voting as a means of social protest or may see volunteering as a better way to spend their time .",0

7977,"By using loopholes in the laws , political parties and political action committees donated large sums of money to candidates , and new reforms were soon needed .",0
7978,"Senators John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Russ Feingold ( former D - WI ) cosponsored the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 ( BCRA ) , also referred to as the McCain – Feingold Act .",0
7979,"McCain – Feingold restricts the amount of money given to political parties , which had become a way for companies and PACs to exert influence .",1
7980,"The court ruling also allowed corporations to place unlimited money into super PACs , or Independent Expenditure - Only Committees .",0
7981,"These organizations can not contribute directly to a candidate , nor can they strategize with a candidate ’s campaign .",0
7982,"Senator or House member , some states use the top - two primary method .",0
7983,"A top - two primary , sometimes called a jungle primary , pits all candidates against each other , regardless of party affiliation .",1
7984,The two candidates with the most votes become the final candidates for the general election .,0
7985,"It was , however , one of the worst occurrences .",0
7986,"States have been frontloading since the 1976 presidential election , with the problem becoming more severe in the 1992 election and later .

7987,The general election campaign period occurs between mid - August and early November .,0
7988,"These elections are simpler than primaries and conventions , because there are only two major party candidates and a few minor party candidates .",0
7989,"In forty - eight states and the District of Columbia , the candidate who wins the most votes in November receives all the state ’s electoral votes , and only the electors from that party will vote .",1
7990,This is often called the winner - take - all system .,0
7991,"In two states , Nebraska and Maine , the electoral votes are divided .",0
7992,"During a presidential election year , members of Congress often experience the coattail effect , which gives members of a popular presidential candidate ’s party an increase in popularity and raises their odds of retaining office .",1
7993,"During a midterm election year , however , the president ’s party often is blamed for the president ’s actions or inaction .",0
7994,"There are more candidates vying to become their party ’s nominee , and party identification is not a useful cue because each party has many candidates rather than just one .",0
7995,"In the 2016 presidential election , Republican voters in the early primaries were presented with a number of options , including Mike Huckabee , Donald Trump , Jeb Bush , Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio , John Kasich , Chris Christie , Carly Fiorina , Ben Carson , and more .",0
7996,"( Huckabee , Christie , and Fiorina dropped out relatively early . )",0
7997,Another source of negative ads is from groups outside the campaigns .,0
7998,"Sometimes , shadow campaigns , run by political action committees and other organizations without the coordination or guidance of candidates , also use negative ads to reach voters .",0
7999,"Even before the Citizens United decision allowed corporations and interest groups to run ads supporting candidates , shadow campaigns existed .",0
8000,"Over time , however , ads became more negative and manipulative .",0
8001,"In reaction , the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 , or McCain – Feingold , included a requirement that candidates stand by their ad and include a recorded statement within the ad stating that they approved the message .",0
8002,"Although ads , especially those run by super PACs , continue to be negative , candidates can no longer dodge responsibility for them .",0
8003,"In essence , this is retrospective voting , but it requires little of the voter .",0
8004,"In congressional and local elections , incumbents win reelection up to 90 percent of the time , a result called the incumbency advantage .",1
8005,What contributes to this advantage and often persuades competent challengers not to run ?,0
8006,"Finally , the recall is one of the more unusual forms of direct democracy ; it allows voters to decide whether to remove a government official from office .",1
8007,"All states have ways to remove officials , but removal by voters is less common .",0
8008,"First , while citizens of these states believe smoking or consuming marijuana should be legal , the U.S. government does not .",0
8009,"The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) , passed by Congress in 1970 , declares marijuana a dangerous drug and makes its sale a prosecutable act .",1

8013,Why did the group risk alienating Democratic voters by preventing Sanders from speaking ?,0
8014,"The work of the news media differs from public relations , which is communication carried out to improve the image of companies , organizations , or candidates for office .",0
8015,Public relations is not a neutral information form .,0
8016,"Walter Cronkite , reporting from Vietnam , had a loyal following .",0
8017,"In a broadcast following the Tet Offensive in 1968 , Cronkite expressed concern that the United States was mired in a conflict that would end in a stalemate.“Walter Cronkite ’s ‘ We Are Mired in Stalemate’ Broadcast , February 27 , 1968 ” Digital History , http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/active_learning/explorations/vietnam/cronkite.cfm ( November 29 , 2015 ) .",0
8018,"His coverage was based on opinion after viewing the war from the ground . Joel Achenbach , “ Cronkite and Vietnam , ” Washington Post , 18 May 2012 .",0
8019,"Although the number of people supporting the war had dwindled by this time , Cronkite ’s commentary bolstered opposition .",0
8020,"The tabloid - style paper included editorial pages , cartoons , and pictures , while the front - page news was sensational and scandalous .",1
8021,This style of coverage became known as yellow journalism .,0
8022,"Flash mobs are examples of collective behavior , noninstitutionalized activity in which several or many people voluntarily engage .",1
8023,Other examples are a group of commuters traveling home from work and a population of teens adopting a favorite singer ’s hairstyle .,0
8024,"Casual crowds consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are n’t really interacting , such as people standing in line at the post office .",1
8025,"Conventional crowds are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly , like a religious service .",1
8026,"Expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion , often at funerals , weddings , or the like .",1
8027,"The final type , acting crowds , focuses on a specific goal or action , such as a protest movement or riot . In addition to the different types of crowds , collective groups can also be identified in two other ways .",1
8028,"A mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest , though they may not be in close proximity ( Lofland 1993 ) , such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville .",1
8029,"A public , on the other hand , is an unorganized , relatively diffused group of people who share ideas , such as the Libertarian political party .",1
8030,"Neil Smelser ’s ( 1962 ) meticulous categorization of crowd behavior , called value - added theory , is a perspective within the functionalist tradition based on the idea that several conditions must be in place for collective behavior to occur .",1
8031,Each condition adds to the likelihood that collective behavior will occur .,0
8032,"Social organizations worldwide take stands on such general areas of concern as poverty , sex trafficking , and the use of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) in food .",0
8033,"Nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) are sometimes formed to support such movements , such as the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement ( FOAM ) .",0
8034,"Global efforts to reduce poverty are represented by the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief ( OXFAM ) , among others .",0
8035,is a revolutionary movement .,0
8036,"Religious / Redemptive movements are “ meaning seeking , ” and their goal is to provoke inner change or spiritual growth in individuals .",1
8037,Organizations pushing these movements include Heaven ’s Gate or the Branch Davidians .,0
8038,Resource MobilizationMcCarthy and Zald ( 1977 ) conceptualize resource mobilization theory as a way to explain movement success in terms of the ability to acquire resources and mobilize individuals .,1
8039,"Resources are primarily time and money , and the more of both , the greater the power of organized movements .",0
8040,Successful social movements use three kinds of frames ( Snow and Benford 1988 ) to further their goals .,0
8041,"The first type , diagnostic framing , states the problem in a clear , easily understood way .",1
8042,"When applying diagnostic frames , there are no shades of gray : instead , there is the belief that what “ they ” do is wrong and this is how “ we ” will fix it .",0
8043,"In the gay marriage movement , a call to action might encourage you to vote “ no ” on Proposition 8 in California ( a move to limit marriage to male - female couples ) , or conversely , to contact your local congressperson to express your viewpoint that marriage should be restricted to male - female couples .",0
8044,"With so many similar diagnostic frames , some groups find it best to join together to maximize their impact .",0
8045,"When social movements link their goals to the goals of other social movements and merge into a single group , a frame alignment process ( Snow et al . 1986 ) occurs — an ongoing and intentional means of recruiting participants to the movement .",1
8046,How has this technology affected social change in our society and others ?,0
8047,One very positive way is crowdsourcing .,0
8048,"Thanks to the web , digital crowdsourcing is the process of obtaining needed services , ideas , or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people , and especially from an online community rather than from traditional employees or suppliers .",1
8049,"Web - based companies such as Kickstarter have been created precisely for the purposes of raising large amounts of money in a short period of time , notably by sidestepping the traditional financing process .",0
8050,"Sociology is the study of groups and group interactions , societies and social interactions , from small and personal groups to very large groups .",1
8051,"A group of people who live in a defined geographic area , who interact with one another , and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society .",1
8052,Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society .,0
8053,It is impossible to study one without the other .,0
8054,German sociologist Norbert Elias called the process of simultaneously analyzing the behavior of individuals and the society that shapes that behavior figuration .,1
8055,An application that makes this concept understandable is the practice of religion .,0
8056,"This even applied to the researchers themselves , who , they believed , should be aware of how their own cultural biases could influence their research .",0
8057,"To deal with this problem , Weber and Dilthey introduced the concept of verstehen , a German word that means to understand in a deep way .",1
8058,"In seeking verstehen , outside observers of a social world — an entire culture or a small setting — attempt to understand it from an insider ’s point of view . In his book The Nature of Social Action ( 1922 ) , Weber described sociology as striving to """" interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds and the effects it produces . """"",0
8059,Researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior .,0
8060,"Qualitative sociology seeks to understand human behavior by learning about it through in - depth interviews , focus groups , and analysis of content sources ( like books , magazines , journals , and popular media ) .",1
8061,"Macro - level theories relate to large - scale issues and large groups of people , while micro - level theories look at very specific relationships between individuals or small groups .",1
8062,Grand theories attempt to explain large - scale relationships and answer fundamental questions such as why societies form and why they change .,1
8063,Sociological theory is constantly evolving and should never be considered complete .,0
8064,"Functionalism grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist , Hebert Spencer ( 1820–1903 ) , who saw similarities between society and the human body ; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning , the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning ( Spencer 1898 ) .",0
8065,"The parts of society that Spencer referred to were the social institutions , or patterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs , such as government , education , family , healthcare , religion , and the economy .",1
8066,"Durkheim believed that individuals may make up society , but in order to study society , sociologists have to look beyond individuals to social facts .",0
8067,"Social facts are the laws , morals , values , religious beliefs , customs , fashions , rituals , and all of the cultural rules that govern social life ( Durkheim 1895 ) .",1
8068,Each of these social facts serves one or more functions within a society .,0
8069,Conflict TheoryConflict theory looks at society as a competition for limited resources .,1
8070,"This perspective is a macro - level approach most identified with the writings of German philosopher and sociologist Karl Marx ( 1818–1883 ) , who saw society as being made up of individuals in different social classes who must compete for social , material , and political resources such as food and housing , employment , education , and leisure time .",0
8071,Constructivism is an extension of symbolic interaction theory which proposes that reality is what humans cognitively construct it to be .,1
8072,"We develop social constructs based on interactions with others , and those constructs that last over time are those that have meanings which are widely agreed - upon or generally accepted by most within the society .",0
8073,People commonly try to understand the happenings in their world by finding or creating an explanation for an occurrence .,0
8074,Social scientists may develop a hypothesis for the same reason .,0
8075,"A hypothesis is a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables ; it ’s a possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances , as well as among various groups or in different places .",1
8076,Reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in a group .,0
8077,"Researchers also strive for validity , which refers to how well the study measures what it was designed to measure .",1
8078,"Returning to the crime rate during a full moon topic , reliability of a study would reflect how well the resulting experience represents the average adult crime rate during a full moon .",0
8079,A hypothesis is an assumption about how two or more variables are related ; it makes a conjectural statement about the relationship between those variables .,1
8080,"In sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another .",0
8081,"While many sociologists rely on the scientific method as a research approach , others operate from an interpretive framework .",0
8082,"While systematic , this approach does n’t follow the hypothesis - testing model that seeks to find generalizable results .",0
8083,"As a research method , a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions , often in the form of a questionnaire .",1
8084,The survey is one of the most widely used scientific research methods .,0
8085,The success of a study depends on how well a population is represented by the sample .,0
8086,"In a random sample , every person in a population has the same chance of being chosen for the study .",1
8087,"According to the laws of probability , random samples represent the population as a whole .",0
8088,"The researcher will end up with a wide range of responses , some of which may be surprising .",0
8089,"The benefit of written opinions , though , is the wealth of material that they provide . An interview is a one - on - one conversation between the researcher and the subject , and it is a way of conducting surveys on a topic .",1
8090,Interviews are similar to the short - answer questions on surveys in that the researcher asks subjects a series of questions .,0
8091,"Later , he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology .",0
8092,"However , Rothman ’s entertaining article still offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “ dot com ” company and exemplified the lengths to which a sociologist will go to uncover material . Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation , in which researchers join people and participate in a group ’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context .",1
8093,This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life .,0
8094,"One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment , meaning they investigate relationships to test a hypothesis — a scientific approach .",1
8095,A researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records .,0
8096,"To guide the search through a vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources , sociologists employ content analysis , applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand .",1
8097,"Or if you are having coffee with a good friend , perhaps that question warrants a more detailed response .",0
8098,"These examples are all aspects of culture , which is shared beliefs , values , and practices , that participants must learn .",1
8099,"Sociologically , we examine in what situation and context certain behavior is expected , and in which situations perhaps it is not .",0
8100,"ethnocentrism , or evaluating and judging another culture based on how it compares to one ’s own cultural norms .",1
8101,"Ethnocentrism , as sociologist William Graham Sumner ( 1906 ) described the term , involves a belief or attitude that one ’s own culture is better than all others .",0
8102,Values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching a culture ’s beliefs .,0
8103,Beliefs are the tenets or convictions that people hold to be true .,1
8104,"Individuals in a society have specific beliefs , but they also share collective values .",0
8105,A boy who helps an elderly woman board a bus may receive a smile and a “ thank you . ” A business manager who raises profit margins may receive a quarterly bonus .,0
8106,"People sanction certain behaviors by giving their support , approval , or permission , or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and nonsupport .",0
8107,"Sanctions are a form of social control , a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms .",1
8108,"Formal norms are established , written rules .",1
8109,They are behaviors worked out and agreed upon in order to suit and serve the most people .,0
8110,Writing another person ’s words as if they are one ’s own has a name — plagiarism .,1
8111,"The consequences for violating this norm are severe and usually result in expulsion . Unlike mores , folkways are norms without any moral underpinnings .",1
8112,"Rather , folkways direct appropriate behavior in the day - to - day practices and expressions of a culture .",0
8113,"In the United States , for example , the number thirteen is associated with bad luck .",0
8114,"In Japan , however , the number four is considered unlucky , since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for “ death . ” The Sapir - Whorf hypothesis is based on the idea that people experience their world through their language , and that they therefore understand their world through the culture embedded in their language .",0
8115,"The hypothesis , which has also been called linguistic relativity , states that language shapes thought ( Swoyer 2003 ) .",1
8116,Subculture and CountercultureA subculture is just what it sounds like — a smaller cultural group within a larger culture ; people of a subculture are part of the larger culture but also share a specific identity within a smaller group .,1
8117,Hunter - gatherer societies demonstrate the strongest dependence on the environment of the various types of preindustrial societies .,0
8118,"As the basic structure of human society until about 10,000–12,000 years ago , these groups were based around kinship or tribes .",0
8119,"His primary concern was that the cultural glue that held society together was failing , and people were becoming more divided .",0
8120,"In his book The Division of Labor in Society ( 1893 ) , Durkheim argued that as society grew more complex , social order made the transition from mechanical to organic . Preindustrial societies , Durkheim explained , were held together by mechanical solidarity , a type of social order maintained by the collective consciousness of a culture .",0
8121,Societies with mechanical solidarity act in a mechanical fashion ; things are done mostly because they have always been done that way .,0
8122,"Additionally , Marx saw conflict in society as the primary means of change .",0
8123,"Economically , he saw conflict existing between the owners of the means of production — the bourgeoisie — and the laborers , called the proletariat .",1
8124,Marx maintained that these conflicts appeared consistently throughout history during times of social revolution .,0
8125,Another idea that Marx developed is the concept of false consciousness .,0
8126,"False consciousness is a condition in which the beliefs , ideals , or ideology of a person are not in the person ’s own best interest .",1
8127,"The symbolic interactionism theory , the third of the three most recognized theories of sociology , is based on Weber ’s early ideas that emphasize the viewpoint of the individual and how that individual relates to society .",0
8128,"For Weber , the culmination of industrialization , rationalization , and the like results in what he referred to as the iron cage , in which the individual is trapped by institutions and bureaucracy .",1
8129,"This leads to a sense of “ disenchantment of the world , ” a phrase Weber used to describe the final condition of humanity .",1
8130,Another way of looking at this concept is through W.I .,0
8131,"Thomas ’s notable Thomas theorem which states , “ If men define situations as real , they are real in their consequences ” ( Thomas and Thomas 1928 ) .",0
8132,"That is , people ’s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality .",0
8133,Sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that a person experiences according to their rank and role in society .,1
8134,"Some statuses are ascribed — those you do not select , such as son , elderly person , or female .",1
8135,"All we can observe is behavior , or role performance .",0
8136,Role performance is how a person expresses his or her role .,1
8137,Sociologist Erving Goffman presented the idea that a person is like an actor on a stage .,0
8138,And commuting times and distances have continued to increase as new suburbs developed farther and farther from city centers .,0
8139,"Simultaneously , this dynamic contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use , like petroleum , which sequentially increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions . As the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm , those who could afford it turned to the exurbs , communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute .",1
8140,"Together , the suburbs , exurbs , and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis .",1
8141,"As the Social Policy & Debate feature illustrates , the suburbs also have their share of socio - economic problems .",0
8142,"In the United States , white flight refers to the migration of economically secure white people from racially mixed urban areas and toward the suburbs .",1
8143,"This occurred throughout the twentieth century , due to causes as diverse as the legal end of racial segregation established by Brown v. Board of Education to the Mariel boatlift of Cubans fleeing Cuba ’s Mariel port for Miami .",0
8144,"While you might be more familiar with the phrase “ global warming , ” climate change is the term now used to refer to long - term shifts in temperatures due to human activity and , in particular , the release of greenhouse gases into the environment .",1
8145,"The planet as a whole is warming , but the term climate change acknowledges that the short - term variations in this process can include both higher and lower temperatures , despite the overarching trend toward warmth .",0
8146,"Often , the stories are not newsmakers , but simply an unpleasant part of life for the people who live near toxic sites such as Centralia , Pennsylvania and Hinkley , California .",0
8147,"In many cases , people in these neighborhoods can be part of a cancer cluster without realizing the cause .",0
8148,Where will people live ?,0
8149,"To explore these questions , we turn to demography , or the study of populations .",1
8150,"Three of the most important components that affect the issues above are fertility , mortality , and migration . The fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born .",1
8151,"Changing fertility , mortality , and migration rates make up the total population composition , a snapshot of the demographic profile of a population .",1
8152,"This number can be measured for societies , nations , world regions , or other groups .",0
8153,"Ehrlich 's ideas suggest that the human population is moving rapidly toward complete environmental collapse , as privileged people use up or pollute a number of environmental resources such as water and air .",0
8154,"He advocated for a goal of zero population growth ( ZPG ) , in which the number of people entering a population through birth or immigration is equal to the number of people leaving it via death or emigration .",1
8155,"While support for this concept is mixed , it is still considered a possible solution to global overpopulation .",0
8156,"Later , George Herbert Mead ( 1863–1931 ) studied the self , a person ’s distinct identity that is developed through social interaction .",1
8157,"In order to engage in this process of “ self , ” an individual has to be able to view him or herself through the eyes of others .",0
8158,"Most importantly , we have to learn language — whether it ’s the dominant language or one common in a subculture , whether it ’s verbal or through signs — in order to communicate and to think .",0
8159,"As we saw with Danielle , without socialization we literally have no self . Nature versus NurtureSome experts assert that who we are is a result of nurture — the relationships and caring that surround us .",1
8160,Others argue that who we are is based entirely in genetics .,0
8161,"Just as young children pretend to be doctors or lawyers , play house , and dress up , adults also engage in anticipatory socialization , the preparation for future life roles .",1
8162,Examples would include a couple who cohabitate before marriage or soon - to - be parents who read infant care books and prepare their home for the new arrival .,0
8163,Peer GroupsA peer group is made up of people who are similar in age and social status and who share interests .,1
8164,"Peer group socialization begins in the earliest years , such as when kids on a playground teach younger children the norms about taking turns , the rules of a game , or how to shoot a basket .",0
8165,"The term group is an amorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings , from just two people ( think about a “ group project ” in school when you partner with another student ) , a club , a regular gathering of friends , or people who work together or share a hobby .",1
8166,"In short , the term refers to any collection of at least two people who interact with some frequency and who share a sense that their identity is somehow aligned with the group .",0
8167,Types of GroupsSociologist Charles Horton Cooley ( 1864–1929 ) suggested that groups can broadly be divided into two categories : primary groups and secondary groups ( Cooley 1909 ) .,0
8168,"According to Cooley , primary groups play the most critical role in our lives .",0
8169,"The feeling that we belong in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way .",0
8170,Sociologist William Sumner ( 1840–1910 ) developed the concepts of in - group and out - group to explain this phenomenon ( Sumner 1906 ) .,0
8171,"In short , an in - group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to , and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is .",1
8172,"After all , how well could soldiers function in a battle if they had no idea whom to listen to or if different people were calling out orders ?",0
8173,"Other secondary groups , like a workplace or a classroom , also have formal leaders , but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly . Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader .",1
8174,An instrumental leader is one who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks .,1
8175,Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's experiences provide an example of the way society reacts to a high - profile woman who is an instrumental leader .,0
8176,"Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership . In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles .",0
8177,Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making .,1
8178,"While this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and guidelines , it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress .",0
8179,"As the name suggests , authoritarian leaders issue orders and assigns tasks .",1
8180,These leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals .,0
8181,"From schools to businesses to healthcare to government , these organizations , referred to as formal organizations , are highly bureaucratized .",0
8182,"Indeed , all formal organizations are , or likely will become , bureaucracies .",0
8183,A bureaucracy is an ideal type of formal organization .,1
8184,These may include prison or a rehabilitation center .,0
8185,Symbolic interactionist Erving Goffman states that most coercive organizations are total institutions ( 1961 ) .,0
8186,A total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place .,1
8187,"A clear division of labor refers to the fact that within a bureaucracy , each individual has a specialized task to perform .",1
8188,"For example , psychology professors teach psychology , but they do not attempt to provide students with financial aid forms .",0
8189,This results in an impersonal organization .,0
8190,"Customers frequently complain that stores like Walmart care little about individuals , other businesses , and the community at large . Bureaucracies are , in theory at least , meritocracies , meaning that hiring and promotion is based on proven and documented skills , rather than on nepotism or random choice .",1
8191,"In order to get into a prestigious college , you need to perform well on the SAT and have an impressive transcript .",0
8192,And what is the relationship between deviance and crime ?,0
8193,"According to sociologist William Graham Sumner , deviance is a violation of established contextual , cultural , or social norms , whether folkways , mores , or codified law ( 1906 ) .",1
8194,It can be as minor as picking your nose in public or as major as committing murder .,0
8195,Think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager .,0
8196,"When a worker violates a workplace guideline , the manager steps in to enforce the rules ; when an employee is doing an exceptionally good job at following the rules , the manager may praise or promote the employee . The means of enforcing rules are known as sanctions .",1
8197,Sanctions can be positive as well as negative .,0
8198,"Although shoplifting , a form of social deviance , may be illegal , there are no laws dictating the proper way to scratch your nose .",0
8199,"That does n’t mean picking your nose in public wo n’t be punished ; instead , you will encounter informal sanctions .",0
8200,Informal sanctions emerge in face - to - face social interactions .,0
8201,"Developed by researchers at the University of Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s , social disorganization theory asserts that crime is most likely to occur in communities with weak social ties and the absence of social control .",1
8202,"An individual who grows up in a poor neighborhood with high rates of drug use , violence , teenage delinquency , and deprived parenting is more likely to become a criminal than an individual from a wealthy neighborhood with a good school system and families who are involved positively in the community .",0
8203,"Conflict theory was greatly influenced by the work of German philosopher , economist , and social scientist Karl Marx .",0
8204,Marx believed that the general population was divided into two groups .,0
8205,Sociologist Edwin Lemert expanded on the concepts of labeling theory and identified two types of deviance that affect identity formation .,0
8206,Primary deviance is a violation of norms that does not result in any long - term effects on the individual ’s self - image or interactions with others .,1
8207,"Speeding is a deviant act , but receiving a speeding ticket generally does not make others view you as a bad person , nor does it alter your own self - concept .",0
8208,"Since criminology was a young field , he drew on other aspects of sociology including social interactions and group learning ( Laub 2006 ) .",0
8209,"His conclusions established differential association theory , which suggested that individuals learn deviant behavior from those close to them who provide models of and opportunities for deviance .",1
8210,"According to Sutherland , deviance is less a personal choice and more a result of differential socialization processes .",0
8211,"In modern U.S. society , crimes are classified as one of two types based on their severity .",0
8212,Violent crimes ( also known as “ crimes against a person ” ) are based on the use of force or the threat of force .,1
8213,"Rape , murder , and armed robbery fall under this category .",0
8214,"When we think of crime , we often picture street crime , or offenses committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations , usually in public spaces .",1
8215,"An often overlooked category is corporate crime , or crime committed by white - collar workers in a business environment .",1
8216,"Embezzlement , insider trading , and identity theft are all types of corporate crime .",0
8217,"Due to these issues , the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics publishes a separate self - report study known as the National Crime Victimization Report ( NCVR ) .",0
8218,"A self - report study is a collection of data gathered using voluntary response methods , such as questionnaires or telephone interviews .",1
8219,"Self - report data are gathered each year , asking approximately 160,000 people in the United States about the frequency and types of crime they ’ve experienced in their daily lives ( BJS 2013 ) .",0
8220,"CourtsOnce a crime has been committed and a violator has been identified by the police , the case goes to court .",0
8221,A court is a system that has the authority to make decisions based on law .,1
8222,The U.S. judicial system is divided into federal courts and state courts .,0
8223,The first is differential class - based access to technology in the form of the digital divide .,0
8224,"This digital divide has led to the second form , a knowledge gap , which is , as it sounds , an ongoing and increasing gap in information for those who have less access to technology .",1
8225,"Simply put , students in well - funded schools receive more exposure to technology than students in poorly funded schools .",0
8226,"According to the functionalist perspective , health is vital to the stability of the society , and therefore sickness is a sanctioned form of deviance .",0
8227,Talcott Parsons ( 1951 ) was the first to discuss this in terms of the sick role : patterns of expectations that define appropriate behavior for the sick and for those who take care of them .,0
8228,"As we discussed in the beginning of the chapter , interactionists focus on the specific meanings and causes people attribute to illness .",1
8229,The term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes “ bad ” behavior into “ sick ” behavior .,1
8230,"A related process is demedicalization , in which “ sick ” behavior is normalized again .",1
8231,"Unfortunately , the U.S. Census Current Population Survey of 2013 shows that 18 percent of people in the United States have no health insurance at all .",0
8232,"Equally alarming , a study by the Commonwealth Fund shows that in 2010 , 81 million adults were either uninsured or underinsured ; that is , people who pay at least 10 percent of their income on healthcare costs not covered by insurance or , for low - income adults , those whose medical expenses or deductibles are at least 5 percent of their income ( Schoen , Doty , Robertson , and Collins 2011 ) .",0
8233,"The Commonwealth study further reports that while underinsurance has historically been an issue that low - income families faced , today it is affecting middle - income families more and more . Why are so many people uninsured or underinsured ?",0
8234,"The best example of socialized medicine is in Great Britain , where the National Health System ( NHS ) gives free healthcare to all its residents .",0
8235,"And despite some U.S. citizens’ knee - jerk reaction to any healthcare changes that hint of socialism , the United States has one socialized system with the Veterans Health Administration . It is important to distinguish between socialized medicine , in which the government owns the healthcare system , and universal healthcare , which is simply a system that guarantees healthcare coverage for everyone .",1
8236,"Germany , Singapore , and Canada all have universal healthcare .",0
8237,Marilyn Winkleby and her research associates ( 1992 ) state that “ one of the strongest and most consistent predictors of a person 's morbidity and mortality experience is that person 's socioeconomic status ( SES ) .,0
8238,"This finding persists across all diseases with few exceptions , continues throughout the entire lifespan , and extends across numerous risk factors for disease . ” Morbidity is the incidence of disease . It is important to remember that economics are only part of the SES picture ; research suggests that education also plays an important role .",1
8239,"Phelan and Link ( 2003 ) note that many behavior - influenced diseases like lung cancer ( from smoking ) , coronary artery disease ( from poor eating and exercise habits ) , and AIDS initially were widespread across SES groups .",0
8240,"Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress that we all feel at some point , but anxiety disorders are feelings of worry and fearfulness that last for months at a time .",1
8241,"Anxiety disorders include obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , panic disorders , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and both social and specific phobias . The second most common mental disorders in the United States are mood disorders ; roughly 10 percent of U.S. adults are likely to be affected yearly , while 21 percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) .",0
8242,"Major mood disorders are depression , bipolar disorder , and dysthymic disorder .",0
8243,The World Health Organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe handicaps that ’s important to the sociological perspective .,0
8244,"They use the term impairment to describe the physical limitations , while reserving the term disability to refer to the social limitation .",1
8245,"Before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) in 1990 , people in the United States with disabilities were often excluded from opportunities and social institutions many of us take for granted .",0
8246,Social epidemiology is the study of the causes and distribution of diseases .,1
8247,Social epidemiology can reveal how social problems are connected to the health of different populations .,0
8248,"The stigma may keep people from seeking help for their illness , making it worse than it needs to be .",0
8249,Contested illnesses are those that are questioned or questionable by some medical professionals .,1
8250,"Disorders like fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome may be either true illnesses or only in the patients’ heads , depending on the opinion of the medical professional .",0
8251,"These are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and useful process , product , or machine , or for a significant improvement to existing technologies .",0
8252,The second type of patent is a design patent .,0
8253,"Commonly conferred in architecture and industrial design , this means someone has invented a new and original design for a manufactured product .",1
8254,New media encompasses all interactive forms of information exchange .,1
8255,"These include social networking sites , blogs , podcasts , wikis , and virtual worlds .",0
8256,But the numbers are misleading .,0
8257,Media consolidation is a process in which fewer and fewer owners control the majority of media outlets .,1
8258,This creates an oligopoly in which a few firms dominate the media marketplace .,1
8259,Such a fast - paced dynamic is not always to our benefit .,0
8260,"Some sociologists assert that this level of media exposure leads to narcotizing dysfunction , a result in which people are too overwhelmed with media input to really care about the issue , so their involvement becomes defined by awareness instead of by action ( Lazerfeld and Merton 1948 ) .",1
8261,"Increasingly prominent in the discussion of new media and feminism is cyberfeminism , the application to , and promotion of , feminism online .",1
8262,Research on cyberfeminism runs the gamut from the liberating use of blogs by women living in Iraq during the second Gulf War ( Peirce 2011 ) to an investigation of the Suicide Girls web site ( Magnet 2007 ) .,0
8263,"Geography , race , gender , and other factors have always played a role in the reality of success .",0
8264,"More recently , the increased outsourcing — or contracting a job or set of jobs to an outside source — of manufacturing jobs to developing nations has greatly diminished the number of high - paying , often unionized , blue - collar positions available .",1
8265,These thinkers believed that ideas and social constructs must be proven to work before they could be accepted .,0
8266,"Philosopher William James was one of the key proponents of the closely related concept of pragmatism , which held that Americans needed to experiment with different ideas and perspectives to find the truth about American society , rather than assuming that there was truth in old , previously accepted models .",1
8267,"Only by tying ideas , thoughts , and statements to actual objects and occurrences could one begin to identify a coherent truth , according to James .",0
8268,Two powerful Republican leaders attempted to control the president .,0
8269,"The first was Roscoe Conkling , Republican senator from New York and leader of the Stalwarts , a group that strongly supported continuation of the current spoils system ( [ link ] ) .",1
8270,"Long supporting former President Grant , Conkling had no sympathy for some of Hayes’ early appeals for civil service reform .",0
8271,"Unable to find such a man , the predominant Half - Breeds again turned to their own leader , Senator Blaine .",0
8272,"However , when news of his many personal corrupt bargains began to surface , a significant portion of the party chose to break from the traditional Stalwarts - versus - Half - Breeds debate and form their own faction , the Mugwumps , a name taken from the Algonquin phrase for “ great chief . ”",0
8273,"The Farmers’ Alliance , a conglomeration of three regional alliances formed in the mid-1880s , took root in the wake of the Grange movement .",1
8274,"In 1890 , Dr. Charles Macune , who led the Southern Alliance , which was based in Texas and had over 100,000 members by 1886 , urged the creation of a national alliance between his organization , the Northwest Alliance , and the Colored Alliance , the largest African American organization in the United States .",1
8275,A notable example of the government ’s failure to act was the story of Coxey ’s Army .,0
8276,"In the spring of 1894 , businessman Jacob Coxey led a march of unemployed Ohioans from Cincinnati to Washington , DC , where leaders of the group urged Congress to pass public works legislation for the federal government to hire unemployed workers to build roads and other public projects .",1
8277,It was not until Theodore Roosevelt unexpectedly became president in 1901 that the federal government would engage in Progressive reforms .,0
8278,"Before then , Progressivism was work done by the people , for the people .",0
8279,What knit Progressives together was the feeling that the country was moving at a dangerous pace in a dangerous direction and required the efforts of everyday Americans to help put it back on track .,0
8280,"Another series of reforms pushed forward by Progressives that sought to sidestep the power of special interests in state legislatures and restore the democratic political process were three election innovations — the initiative , referendum , and recall .",0
8281,"The first permitted voters to enact legislation by petitioning to place an idea , or initiative , on the ballot .",1
8282,The image below ( [ link ] ) shows a machinist in a factory where Taylor had consulted ; he is alone and focused solely on his job .,0
8283,"Progressive in its emphasis on efficiency , the use of science , and the reliance on experts , Taylorism , as scientific management became known , was not widely popular among workers who resented managerial authority and the loss of autonomy over their work .",1
8284,"Many workers went on strikes in response , although some favored Taylor ’s methods , since their pay was directly linked to the productivity increases that his methods achieved and since increased efficiency allowed companies to charge consumers lower prices .",0
8285,"White middle - class reformers were appalled at the violence of race relations in the nation but typically shared the belief in racial characteristics and the superiority of Anglo - Saxon whites over African Americans , Asians , “ ethnic ” Europeans , Indians , and Latin American populations .",0
8286,"Southern reformers considered segregation a Progressive solution to racial violence ; across the nation , educated middle - class Americans enthusiastically followed the work of eugenicists who identified virtually all human behavior as inheritable traits and issued awards at county fairs to families and individuals for their “ racial fitness . ” It was against this tide that African American leaders developed their own voice in the Progressive Era , working along diverse paths to improve the lives and conditions of African Americans throughout the country .",0
8287,"By 1908 , internal fights over the role of women in the fight for African American equal rights lessened the interest in the Niagara Movement .",0
8288,"But the movement laid the groundwork for the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , founded in 1909 .",0
8289,Du Bois served as the influential director of publications for the NAACP from its inception until 1933 .,0
8290,"Although not as flamboyant or outwardly progressive as Roosevelt , Taft ’s organizational skills and generally solid performance as president aligned with the party leadership ’s concerns over another Roosevelt presidency and secured for him the Republican Party ’s nomination .",0
8291,"Angry over this snub , in 1912 , Roosevelt and the other Progressive Republicans bolted from the Republican Party and formed the Progressive Party .",0
8292,His popularity had him hoping to win the presidential race as a third - party candidate .,0
8293,"Fearing future loss of the territory through military conflict , as well as desiring to create challenges for Great Britain ( which they had fought in the Crimean War ) , Russia had happily accepted the American purchase offer .",0
8294,"In the United States , several newspaper editors openly questioned the purchase and labeled it “ Seward ’s Folly ” ( [ link ] ) .",0
8295,They highlighted the lack of Americans to populate the vast region and lamented the challenges in attempting to govern the native peoples in that territory .,0
8296,"Shippers and other businessmen , particularly in the sugar industry , supported American intervention to safeguard their own interests in the region .",0
8297,"Likewise , the “ Cuba Libre ” movement founded by José Martí , who quickly established offices in New York and Florida , further stirred American interest in the liberation cause .",0
8298,"The difference in this uprising , however , was that supporters saw in the renewed U.S. Navy a force that could be a strong ally for Cuba .",0
8299,"Domestically , the country was neither unified in their support of the treaty nor in the idea of the United States building an empire at all .",0
8300,"Many prominent Americans , including Jane Addams , former President Grover Cleveland , Andrew Carnegie , Mark Twain , and Samuel Gompers , felt strongly that the country should not be pursuing an empire , and , in 1898 , they formed the Anti - Imperialist League to oppose this expansionism .",1
8301,"The reasons for their opposition were varied : Some felt that empire building went against the principles of democracy and freedom upon which the country was founded , some worried about competition from foreign workers , and some held the xenophobic viewpoint that the assimilation of other races would hurt the country .",0
8302,"Carranza refused to work with Wilson and the U.S. government , and instead threatened to defend Mexico ’s mineral rights against all American oil companies established there .",0
8303,"Wilson then turned to support rebel forces who opposed Carranza , most notably Pancho Villa ( [ link ] ) .",0
8304,"However , Villa lacked the strength in number or weapons to overtake Carranza ; in 1915 , Wilson reluctantly authorized official U.S. recognition of Carranza ’s government .",0
8305,The war effort was costly — with an eventual price tag in excess of $ 32 billion by 1920—and the government needed to finance it .,0
8306,"The Liberty Loan Act allowed the federal government to sell liberty bonds to the American public , extolling citizens to “ do their part ” to help the war effort and bring the troops home .",1
8307,The government ultimately raised $ 23 billion through liberty bonds .,0
8308,"First during World War I , then again in World War II , these women stepped up to run farms and other agricultural enterprises , as men left for the armed forces ( [ link ] ) .",1
8309,"Known as Farmerettes , some twenty thousand women — mostly college educated and from larger urban areas — served in this capacity .",0
8310,Their reasons for joining were manifold .,0
8311,"As early as January 1918—a full five months before U.S. military forces fired their first shot in the war , and eleven months before the actual armistice — Wilson announced his postwar peace plan before a joint session of Congress .",0
8312,"Referring to what became known as the Fourteen Points , Wilson called for openness in all matters of diplomacy and trade , specifically , free trade , freedom of the seas , an end to secret treaties and negotiations , promotion of self - determination of all nations , and more .",1
8313,"In addition , he called for the creation of a League of Nations to promote the new world order and preserve territorial integrity through open discussions in place of intimidation and war .",0
8314,"Meanwhile , southern lynchings continued to escalate , with white mobs burning African Americans at the stake .",0
8315,"During the “ Red Summer ” of 1919 , northern cities recorded twenty - five bloody race riots that killed over 250 people .",1
8316,"Among these was the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 , where a white mob stoned a young black boy to death because he swam too close to the “ white beach ” on Lake Michigan .",1
8317,"The 1920s opened up new possibilities of mobility for a large percentage of the U.S. population , as automobile manufacturers began to mass produce what had once been a luxury item , and daring aviators both demonstrated and drove advancements in aircraft technology .",0
8318,"The most significant innovation of this era was Henry Ford ’s Model T Ford , which made car ownership available to the average American .",0
8319,"Many of these new immigrants were coming from eastern and southern Europe and , for many English - speaking , native - born Americans of northern European descent , the growing diversity of new languages , customs , and religions triggered anxiety and racial animosity .",0
8320,"In reaction , some embraced nativism , prizing white Americans with older family trees over more recent immigrants , and rejecting outside influences in favor of their own local customs .",1
8321,"Nativists also stoked a sense of fear over the perceived foreign threat , pointing to the anarchist assassinations of the Spanish prime minister in 1897 , the Italian king in 1900 , and even President William McKinley in 1901 as proof .",0
8322,"Many Americans were disillusioned in the post - World War I era , and their reactions took many forms .",0
8323,"Rebellious American youth , in particular , adjusted to the changes by embracing a new morality that was far more permissive than the social mores of their parents .",0
8324,"Many young women of the era shed their mother ’s morality and adopted the dress and mannerisms of a flapper , the Jazz Age female stereotype , seeking the endless party .",1
8325,"The law proved difficult to enforce , as illegal alcohol soon poured in from Canada and the Caribbean , and rural Americans resorted to home - brewed “ moonshine . ” The result was an eroding of respect for law and order , as many people continued to drink illegal liquor .",0
8326,"Rather than bringing about an age of sobriety , as Progressive reformers had hoped , it gave rise to a new subculture that included illegal importers , interstate smuggling ( or bootlegging ) , clandestine saloons referred to as “ speakeasies , ” hipflasks , cocktail parties , and the organized crime of trafficking liquor .",1
8327,"Although his critics depicted him as weak , lazy , or incompetent , he was actually quite shrewd and politically astute .",0
8328,"Together with his running mate , Calvin Coolidge , the governor of Massachusetts , they attracted the votes of many Americans who sought Harding ’s promised return to normalcy .",0
8329,"In the election , Harding defeated Governor James Cox of Ohio by the greatest majority in the history of two - party politics : 61 percent of the popular vote .",0
8330,"Investors , along with the general public , withdrew their money from banks by the thousands , fearing the banks would go under .",0
8331,"The more people pulled out their money in bank runs , the closer the banks came to insolvency ( [ link ] ) .",0
8332,"In 1932 , a major strike at the Ford Motor Company factory near Detroit resulted in over sixty injuries and four deaths .",0
8333,"Often referred to as the Ford Hunger March , the event unfolded as a planned demonstration among unemployed Ford workers who , to protest their desperate situation , marched nine miles from Detroit to the company ’s River Rouge plant in Dearborn .",1
8334,"At the Dearborn city limits , local police launched tear gas at the roughly three thousand protestors , who responded by throwing stones and clods of dirt .",0
8335,This would establish the basis for Franklin Roosevelt ’s “ Good Neighbor ” policy .,0
8336,"After a goodwill tour of Central American countries immediately following his election in 1928 , Hoover shaped the subsequent Clark Memorandum — released in 1930—which largely repudiated the previous Roosevelt Corollary , establishing a basis for unlimited American military intervention throughout Latin America .",1
8337,"To the contrary , through the memorandum , Hoover asserted that greater emphasis should be placed upon the older Monroe Doctrine , in which the U.S. pledged assistance to her Latin American neighbors should any European powers interfere in Western Hemisphere affairs .",1
8338,"The election of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signaled both immediate relief for the American public as well as a permanent shift in the role of the federal government in guiding the economy and providing direct assistance to the people , albeit through expensive programs that made extensive budget deficits commonplace .",0
8339,"For many , the immediate relief was , at a minimum , psychological : Herbert Hoover was gone , and the situation could not grow worse under Roosevelt .",0
8340,"After the landslide election , the country — and Hoover — had to endure the interregnum , the difficult four months between the election and President Roosevelt ’s inauguration in March 1933 .",1
8341,"Congress did not pass a single significant piece of legislation during this period , although Hoover spent much of the time trying to get Roosevelt to commit publicly to a legislative agenda of Hoover ’s choosing .",0
8342,"At its peak , there were some four million Americans repairing bridges , building roads and airports , and undertaking other public projects .",0
8343,Another work program was the Civilian Conservation Corps Relief Act ( CCC ) .,0
8344,The CCC provided government jobs for young men aged fourteen to twenty - four who came from relief families .,1
8345,"Regionally , Roosevelt ’s work was most famously seen in the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) ( [ link ] ) , a federal agency tasked with the job of planning and developing the area through flood control , reforestation , and hydroelectric power .",1
8346,"Employing several thousand Americans on a project that Roosevelt envisioned as a template for future regional redevelopment , the TVA revitalized a river valley that landowners had badly over - farmed , leaving behind eroded soil that lacked essential nutrients for future farming .",0
8347,The Banking Act of 1935 was the most far - reaching revision of banking laws since the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1914 .,1
8348,"Previously , regional reserve banks , particularly the New York Reserve Bank — controlled by the powerful Morgan and Rockefeller families — had dominated policy - making at the Federal Reserve .",0
8349,"Roosevelt sought to salvage this important piece of labor legislation , doing so with the Wagner Act .",0
8350,"The act created the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) to once again protect American workers’ right to unionize and bargain collectively , as well as to provide a federal vehicle for labor grievances to be heard .",1
8351,"Although roundly criticized by the Republican Party and factory owners , the Wagner Act withstood several challenges and eventually received constitutional sanction by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1937 .",0
8352,"Aubrey Williams , the director of the NYA , hired more black administrators than any other federal agency , and appointed them to oversee projects throughout the country .",0
8353,"One key figure in the NYA was Mary McLeod Bethune ( [ link ] ) , a prominent African American educator tapped by Roosevelt to act as the director of the NYA ’s Division of Negro Affairs .",0
8354,"Bethune had been a spokesperson and an educator for years ; with this role , she became one of the president ’s foremost African American advisors .",0
8355,"At a conference in Munich later that year , Great Britain ’s prime minister , Neville Chamberlain , and France ’s prime minister , Édouard Daladier , agreed to the partial dismemberment of Czechoslovakia and the occupation of the Sudetenland ( a region with a sizable German population ) by German troops ( [ link ] ) .",1
8356,"This Munich Pact offered a policy of appeasement , in the hope that German expansionist appetites could be satisfied without war .",0
8357,"But not long after the agreement , Germany occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia as well .",0
8358,"Both groups ended their opposition , however , at the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , respectively .",0
8359,"Nevertheless , during the war , some seventy - two thousand men registered as conscientious objectors ( COs ) , and fifty - two thousand were granted that status .",0
8360,"Of that fifty - two thousand , some accepted noncombat roles in the military , whereas others accepted unpaid work in civilian work camps .",0
8361,"After all , they argued , if the United States were going to denounce Germany and Japan for abusing human rights , the country should itself be as exemplary as possible .",0
8362,"Indeed , CORE ’s actions were in keeping with the goals of the Double V campaign that was begun in 1942 by the Pittsburgh Courier , the largest African American newspaper at the time ( [ link ] ) .",1
8363,The campaign called upon African Americans to accomplish the two “ Vs ” : victory over America ’s foreign enemies and victory over racism in the United States .,1
8364,"The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor unleashed a cascade of racist assumptions about Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans in the United States that culminated in the relocation and internment of 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry , 66 percent of whom had been born in the United States .",0
8365,"Executive Order 9066 , signed by Roosevelt on February 19 , 1942 , gave the army power to remove people from “ military areas ” to prevent sabotage or espionage .",1
8366,"The army then used this authority to relocate people of Japanese ancestry living along the Pacific coast of Washington , Oregon , and California , as well as in parts of Arizona , to internment camps in the American interior .",0
8367,"The “ Bataan Death March , ” during which as many as 650 American and 10,000 Filipino prisoners of war died , intensified anti - Japanese feelings .",1
8368,Kamikaze attacks that took place towards the end of the war were regarded as proof of the irrationality of Japanese martial values and mindless loyalty to Emperor Hirohito .,0
8369,"To counter Soviet influence in the developing world , Kennedy supported a variety of measures .",0
8370,"One of these was the Alliance for Progress , which collaborated with the governments of Latin American countries to promote economic growth and social stability in nations whose populations might find themselves drawn to communism .",1
8371,"Kennedy also established the Agency for International Development to oversee the distribution of foreign aid , and he founded the Peace Corps , which recruited idealistic young people to undertake humanitarian projects in Asia , Africa , and Latin America .",1
8372,"The plan was to develop different strategies , tactics , and even military capabilities to respond more appropriately to small or medium - sized insurgencies , and political or diplomatic crises .",0
8373,"One component of flexible response was the Green Berets , a U.S. Army Special Forces unit trained in counterinsurgency — the military suppression of rebel and nationalist groups in foreign nations .",1
8374,"Much of the Kennedy administration ’s new approach to defense , however , remained focused on the ability and willingness of the United States to wage both conventional and nuclear warfare , and Kennedy continued to call for increases in the American nuclear arsenal .",0
8375,"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race , color , national origin , and religion , also prohibited , in Title VII , discrimination on the basis of sex .",1
8376,"Ironically , protection for women had been included at the suggestion of a Virginia congressman in an attempt to prevent the act ’s passage ; his reasoning seemed to be that , while a white man might accept that African Americans needed and deserved protection from discrimination , the idea that women deserved equality with men would be far too radical for any of his male colleagues to contemplate .",0
8377,"For Carmichael , Black Power was the power of African Americans to unite as a political force and create their own institutions apart from white - dominated ones , an idea also espoused in the 1920s by political leader and orator Marcus Garvey .",1
8378,"Like Garvey , Carmichael became an advocate of black separatism , arguing that African Americans should live apart from whites and solve their problems for themselves .",1
8379,"In keeping with this philosophy , Carmichael expelled SNCC ’s white members .",0
8380,"Besides demobilizing the armed forces and preparing for the homecoming of servicemen and women , he also had to guide the nation through the process of returning to a peacetime economy .",0
8381,"To this end , he proposed an ambitious program of social legislation that included establishing a federal minimum wage , expanding Social Security and public housing , and prohibiting child labor .",0
8382,"Wartime price controls were retained for some items but removed from others , like meat .",0
8383,"In February 1946 , George Kennan , a State Department official stationed at the U.S. embassy in Moscow , sent an eight - thousand - word message to Washington , DC .",0
8384,"In what became known as the “ Long Telegram , ” Kennan maintained that Soviet leaders believed that the only way to protect the Soviet Union was to destroy “ rival ” nations and their influence over weaker nations .",1
8385,"According to Kennan , the Soviet Union was not so much a revolutionary regime as a totalitarian bureaucracy that was unable to accept the prospect of a peaceful coexistence of the United States and itself .",0
8386,"Like dominos toppling one another , entire regions would eventually be controlled by the Soviets .",0
8387,"The demand for anti - Communist containment appeared as early as March 1946 in a speech by Winston Churchill , in which he referred to an Iron Curtain that divided Europe into the “ free ” West and the Communist East controlled by the Soviet Union .",0
8388,Witnesses were subpoenaed and required to testify before the committee ; refusal could result in imprisonment .,0
8389,"Those who invoked Fifth Amendment protections , or were otherwise suspected of Communist sympathies , often lost their jobs or found themselves on a blacklist , which prevented them from securing employment .",0
8390,"Notable artists who were blacklisted in the 1940s and 1950s include composer Leonard Bernstein , novelist Dashiell Hammett , playwright and screenwriter Lillian Hellman , actor and singer Paul Robeson , and musician Artie Shaw .",0
8391,"His New Look strategy embraced nuclear “ massive retaliation , ” a plan for nuclear response to a first Soviet strike so devastating that the attackers would not be able to respond .",1
8392,Some labeled this approach “ Mutually Assured Destruction ” or MAD .,0
8393,"The growing number of cars on the road changed consumption patterns , and drive - in and drive - through convenience stores , restaurants , and movie theaters began to dot the landscape .",0
8394,"The first McDonalds opened in San Bernardino , California , in 1954 to cater to drivers in a hurry .",0
8395,"Not all efforts to enact desegregation required the use of the courts , however .",0
8396,"On April 15 , 1947 , Jackie Robinson started for the Brooklyn Dodgers , playing first base .",0
8397,"He was the first African American to play baseball in the National League , breaking the color barrier .",0
8398,Many national politicians supported the segregationist efforts .,0
8399,"In 1956 , ninety - six members of Congress signed “ The Southern Manifesto , ” in which they accused the U.S. Supreme Court of misusing its power and violating the principle of states’ rights , which maintained that states had rights equal to those of the federal government .",1
8400,“ Hippies ” rejected the conventions of traditional society .,1
8401,"Men sported beards and grew their hair long ; both men and women wore clothing from non - Western cultures , defied their parents , rejected social etiquettes and manners , and turned to music as an expression of their sense of self .",0
8402,"Nixon also courted northern , blue - collar workers , whom he later called the silent majority , to acknowledge their belief that their voices were seldom heard .",1
8403,"These voters feared the social changes taking place in the country : Antiwar protests challenged their own sense of patriotism and civic duty , whereas the recreational use of new drugs threatened their cherished principles of self - discipline , and urban riots invoked the specter of a racial reckoning .",0
8404,The combination of unemployment and rising prices posed an unfamiliar challenge to economists whose fiscal policies of either expanding or contracting federal spending could only address one side of the problem at the cost of the other .,1
8405,"This phenomenon of “ stagflation ” — a term that combined the economic conditions of stagnation and inflation — outlived the Nixon administration , enduring into the early 1980s .",0
8406,"As the conflict wore on and reports of brutalities increased , the antiwar movement grew in strength .",0
8407,"To take the political pressure off himself and his administration , and find a way to exit Vietnam “ with honor , ” Nixon began the process of Vietnamization , turning more responsibility for the war over to South Vietnamese forces by training them and providing American weaponry , while withdrawing U.S. troops from the field .",1
8408,"At the same time , however , Nixon authorized the bombing of neighboring Cambodia , which had declared its neutrality , in an effort to destroy North Vietnamese and Viet Cong bases within that country and cut off supply routes between North and South Vietnam .",0
8409,"In the weeks following the Watergate break - in , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein , reporters for The Washington Post , received information from several anonymous sources , including one known to them only as “ Deep Throat , ” that led them to realize the White House was deeply implicated in the break - in .",0
8410,"As the press focused on other events , Woodward and Bernstein continued to dig and publish their findings , keeping the public ’s attention on the unfolding scandal .",0
8411,"After two unsuccessful Republican primary bids in 1968 and 1976 , Reagan won the presidency in 1980 .",0
8412,His victory was the result of a combination of dissatisfaction with the presidential leadership of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in the 1970s and the growth of the New Right .,0
8413,This group of conservative Americans included many very wealthy financial supporters and emerged in the wake of the social reforms and cultural changes of the 1960s and 1970s .,1
8414,Much of the intellectual meat of the Reagan Revolution came from conservative think tanks ( policy or advocacy groups ) that specifically sought to shape American political and social dialogues .,0
8415,"The Heritage Foundation , one such group , soon became the intellectual arm of the conservative movement .",1
8416,"Because the disease was seen almost exclusively in male homosexuals , it was quickly dubbed “ gay cancer . ” Doctors soon realized it often coincided with other symptoms , including a rare form of pneumonia , and they renamed it “ Gay Related Immune Deficiency ” ( GRID ) , although people other than gay men , primarily intravenous drug users , were dying from the disease as well .",0
8417,"The connection between gay men and GRID — later renamed human immunodeficiency virus / autoimmune deficiency syndrome , or HIV / AIDS — led heterosexuals largely to ignore the growing health crisis in the gay community , wrongly assuming they were safe from its effects .",0
8418,"The federal government also overlooked the disease , and calls for more money to research and find the cure were ignored .",0
8419,"Reagan , however , overlooked the legitimate complaints of the Sandinistas and believed that their rule opened the region to Cuban and Soviet influence .",0
8420,"A year into his presidency , convinced it was folly to allow the expansion of Soviet and Communist influence in Latin America , he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to equip and train a group of anti - Sandinista Nicaraguans known as the Contras ( contrarevolucionários or “ counter - revolutionaries ” ) to oust Ortega .",1
8421,Soon they were mounting fierce opposition to the bill .,0
8422,Moderate conservatives dubbed the reform proposals “ Hillarycare ” and argued that the bill was an unwarranted expansion of the powers of the federal government that would interfere with people ’s ability to choose the healthcare provider they wanted .,0
8423,Those further to the right argued that healthcare reform was part of a larger and nefarious plot to control the public .,0
8424,Lieberman had been quick to denounce Clinton ’s relationship with Monica Lewinsky .,0
8425,"Consumer advocate Ralph Nader ran as the candidate of the Green Party , a party devoted to environmental issues and grassroots activism , and Democrats feared that he would attract votes that Gore might otherwise win .",1
8426,"On September 20 , in an address to a joint session of Congress , Bush declared war on terrorism , blamed al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for the attacks , and demanded that the radical Islamic fundamentalists who ruled Afghanistan , the Taliban , turn bin Laden over or face attack by the United States .",1
8427,"This speech encapsulated what became known as the Bush Doctrine , the belief that the United States has the right to protect itself from terrorist acts by engaging in pre - emptive wars or ousting hostile governments in favor of friendly , preferably democratic , regimes .",1
8428,"Fearing that terrorists might strike within the nation ’s borders again , and aware of the chronic lack of cooperation among different federal law enforcement agencies , Bush created the Office of Homeland Security in October 2001 .",0
8429,"The next year , Congress passed the Homeland Security Act , creating the Department of Homeland Security , which centralized control over a number of different government functions in order to better control threats at home ( [ link ] ) . The Bush administration also pushed the USA Patriot Act through Congress , which enabled law enforcement agencies to monitor citizens’ e - mails and phone conversations without a warrant .",1
8430,"In the end , no such weapons were ever found .",0
8431,"These criticisms were amplified by growing international concern over the treatment of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and widespread disgust over the torture conducted by U.S. troops at the prison in Abu Ghraib , Iraq , which surfaced only months before the election ( [ link ] ) .",0
8432,"Even though CDOs consisted of subprime mortgages , credit card debt , and other risky investments , credit ratings agencies had a financial incentive to rate them as very safe .",0
8433,"Making matters worse , financial institutions created instruments called credit default swaps , which were essentially a form of insurance on investments .",1
8434,"If the investment lost money , the investors would be compensated .",0
8435,This popular denial has had huge global consequences .,0
8436,"In 1998 , the United States , which produces roughly 36 percent of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that prevent the earth ’s heat from escaping into space , signed the Kyoto Protocol , an agreement among the world ’s nations to reduce their emissions of these gases .",1
8437,President Bush objected to the requirement that major industrialized nations limit their emissions to a greater extent than other parts of the world and argued that doing so might hurt the American economy .,0
8438,"With debt upon graduation averaging about $ 29,000 , students may find their economic options limited .",0
8439,"Instead of buying cars or paying for housing , they may have to join the boomerang generation and return to their parents’ homes in order to make their loan payments .",0
8440,"Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air , subject to only the acceleration of gravity .",1
8441,"The object is called a projectile , and its path is called its trajectory .",1
8442,Both are quite different from the velocity of an airplane relative to its passengers ( which should be close to zero ) .,0
8443,"Relative velocities are one aspect of relativity , which is defined to be the study of how different observers moving relative to each other measure the same phenomenon .",1
8444,"[ link](b ) is our first example of a free - body diagram , which is a technique used to illustrate all the external forces acting on a body .",0
8445,"The body is represented by a single isolated point ( or free body ) , and only those forces acting on the body from the outside ( external forces ) are shown .",1
8446,External forces are any outside forces that act on a body .,1
8447,A free - body diagram is a drawing of all external forces acting on a body .,1
8448,The answer is that a change in motion is equivalent to a change in velocity .,0
8449,"A change in velocity means , by definition , that there is an acceleration .",0
8450,"Newton ’s first law says that a net external force causes a change in motion ; thus , we see that a net external force causes acceleration .",1
8451,"When the net external force on an object is its weight , we say that it is in free - fall .",1
8452,"That is , the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity .",0
8453,Section SummaryNewton ’s third law of motion represents a basic symmetry in nature .,0
8454,"It states : Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body , the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that the first body exerts .",1
8455,"A tension is a force along the length of a medium , especially a force carried by a flexible medium , such as a rope or cable .",1
8456,"The word “ tension ” comes from a Latin word meaning “ to stretch . ” Not coincidentally , the flexible cords that carry muscle forces to other parts of the body are called tendons .",0
8457,You feel a smaller drag force when you tilt your hand so only the side goes through the air — you have decreased the area of your hand that faces the direction of motion .,0
8458,"Like friction , the drag force always opposes the motion of an object .",0
8459,"Unlike simple friction , the drag force is proportional to some function of the velocity of the object in that fluid .",0
8460,Consider a line from the center of the CD to its edge .,0
8461,Each pit used to record sound along this line moves through the same angle in the same amount of time .,0
8462,The rotation angle is the amount of rotation and is analogous to linear distance .,1
8463,Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a centripetal force .,1
8464,"The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of curvature , the same as the direction of centripetal acceleration .",0
8465,"To comprehend these vast ranges , we must also have accepted units in which to express them .",0
8466,"And we shall find that ( even in the potentially mundane discussion of meters , kilograms , and seconds ) a profound simplicity of nature appears — all physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of only four fundamental physical quantities : length , mass , time , and electric current . We define a physical quantity either by specifying how it is measured or by stating how it is calculated from other measurements .",0
8467,"For example , we define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them , whereas we define average speed by stating that it is calculated as distance traveled divided by time of travel .",0
8468,It is an intriguing fact that some physical quantities are more fundamental than others and that the most fundamental physical quantities can be defined only in terms of the procedure used to measure them .,1
8469,The units in which they are measured are thus called fundamental units .,0
8470,"In this textbook , the fundamental physical quantities are taken to be length , mass , time , and electric current .",0
8471,The SI unit for length is the meter ( abbreviated m ) ; its definition has also changed over time to become more accurate and precise .,0
8472,"The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole .",0
8473,The term order of magnitude refers to the scale of a value expressed in the metric system .,1
8474,"Each power of 1010 size 12{""""10 """" } in the metric system represents a different order of magnitude .",0
8475,A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult ( or impossible ) to display directly .,1
8476,"While a model is justified with experimental proof , it is only accurate under limited situations .",0
8477,"As scientists inquire and gather information about the world , they follow a process called the scientific method .",0
8478,This process typically begins with an observation and question that the scientist will research .,0
8479,"These theories deal with the very fast and the very small , respectively .",0
8480,Relativity must be used whenever an object is traveling at greater than about 1 % of the speed of light or experiences a strong gravitational field such as that near the Sun .,0
8481,Quantum mechanics must be used for objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope .,0
8482,"Average velocity is displacement ( change in position ) divided by the time of travel ,",1
8483,"For example , for this trip to the store , the position , velocity , and speed - vs .- time graphs are displayed in [ link ] .",0
8484,( Note that these graphs depict a very simplified model of the trip .,0
8485,"We are assuming that speed is constant during the trip , which is unrealistic given that we ’ll probably stop at the store .",0
8486,"When an object slows down , its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion .",1
8487,This is known as deceleration .,0
8488,"A subway train in Sao Paulo , Brazil , decelerates as it comes into a station .",0
8489,"First note that graphs in this text have perpendicular axes , one horizontal and the other vertical .",0
8490,"When two physical quantities are plotted against one another in such a graph , the horizontal axis is usually considered to be an independent variable and the vertical axis a dependent variable .",0
8491,"If we call the horizontal axis the xx size 12{x } { } -axis and the vertical axis the yy size 12{y } { } -axis , as in [ link ] , a straight - line graph has the general formy = mx+b.y = mx+b .",0
8492,"size 12{y= ital """" mx""""+`b } { }",0
8493,These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0 inches .,0
8494,"In contrast , if you had obtained a measurement of 12 inches , your measurement would not be very accurate . The precision of a measurement system is refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements ( which are repeated under the same conditions ) .",1
8495,Consider the example of the paper measurements .,0
8496,"7 """" cm """" } { } , and he or she must estimate the value of the last digit .",0
8497,"Using the method of significant figures , the rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty .",0
8498,"In order to determine the number of significant digits in a value , start with the first measured value at the left and count the number of digits through the last digit written on the right .",0
8499,Distance is an example of a scalar quantity .,0
8500,A vector is any quantity with both magnitude and direction .,1
8501,Other examples of vectors include a velocity of 90 km / h east and a force of 500 newtons straight down .,0
8502,"The head - to - tail method is a graphical way to add vectors , described in [ link ] below and in the steps following .",0
8503,"The tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector , and the head ( or tip ) of a vector is the final , pointed end of the arrow .",0
8504,Head - to - Tail Method : The head - to - tail method of graphically adding vectors is illustrated for the two displacements of the person walking in a city considered in [ link ] .,0
8505,"Step 5 . To get the magnitude of the resultant , measure its length with a ruler .",0
8506,"( Note that in most calculations , we will use the Pythagorean theorem to determine this length .",0
8507,0 { size 12{º } } } { } north of east .,0
8508,This is an example of multiplying a vector by a positive scalar .,0
8509,"Notice that the magnitude changes , but the direction stays the same . If the scalar is negative , then multiplying a vector by it changes the vector ’s magnitude and gives the new vector the opposite direction .",0
8510,Analytical methods of vector addition and subtraction employ geometry and simple trigonometry rather than the ruler and protractor of graphical methods .,0
8511,"Part of the graphical technique is retained , because vectors are still represented by arrows for easy visualization .",0
8512,"Rather than contradicting our experience , Newton ’s first law of motion states that there must be a cause ( which is a net external force ) for there to be any change in velocity ( either a change in magnitude or direction ) .",0
8513,We will define net external force in the next section .,0
8514,"It is obviously more difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that of a basketball , for example .",0
8515,The inertia of an object is measured by its mass .,0
8516,"Roughly speaking , mass is a measure of the amount of “ stuff ” ( or matter ) in something .",0
8517,Inertia is the tendency of an object to remain at rest or remain in motion .,1
8518,Inertia is related to an object ’s mass .,0
8519,What is it that carries forces between objects ?,0
8520,One way to answer this question is to imagine that a force field surrounds whatever object creates the force .,0
8521,A second object ( often called a test object ) placed in this field will experience a force that is a function of location and other variables .,0
8522,One of the simpler characteristics of friction is that it is parallel to the contact surface between systems and always in a direction that opposes motion or attempted motion of the systems relative to each other .,0
8523,"If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another , then the friction between them is called kinetic friction .",1
8524,"For example , friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice .",0
8525,"The physicist chooses Earth because it is very nearly an inertial frame of reference — one in which all forces are real ( that is , in which all forces have an identifiable physical origin ) .",0
8526,"In such a frame of reference , Newton ’s laws of motion take the form given in Dynamics : Newton 's Laws of Motion The car is a non - inertial frame of reference because it is accelerated to the side .",0
8527,The force to the left sensed by car passengers is a fictitious force having no physical origin .,0
8528,A person standing next to the merry - go - round sees the ball moving straight and the merry - go - round rotating underneath it .,0
8529,"In the merry - go - round ’s frame of reference , we explain the apparent curve to the right by using a fictitious force , called the Coriolis force , that causes the ball to curve to the right .",0
8530,"The fictitious Coriolis force can be used by anyone in that frame of reference to explain why objects follow curved paths and allows us to apply Newton ’s Laws in non - inertial frames of reference . Looking down on the counterclockwise rotation of a merry - go - round , we see that a ball slid straight toward the edge follows a path curved to the right .",0
8531,Microgravity refers to an environment in which the apparent net acceleration of a body is small compared with that produced by Earth at its surface .,1
8532,Many interesting biology and physics topics have been studied over the past three decades in the presence of microgravity .,0
8533,"For work , in the scientific sense , to be done , a force must be exerted and there must be displacement in the direction of the force .",0
8534,"Formally , the work done on a system by a constant force is defined to be the product of the component of the force in the direction of motion times the distance through which the force acts .",0

8536,"Work is done by a force , and some forces , such as weight , have special characteristics .",0
8537,"A conservative force is one , like the gravitational force , for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion and not on the path taken .",1

8553,"The likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use , with its production of carbon dioxide through combustion , has made , in the eyes of many scientists , a shift to non - fossil fuels of utmost importance — but it will not be easy .",0
8554,"In [ link ] , a very large force acting for a short time had a great effect on the momentum of the tennis ball .",0
8555,"A small force could cause the same change in momentum , but it would have to act for a much longer time .",0
8556,"For example , if the ball were thrown upward , the gravitational force ( which is much smaller than the tennis racquet ’s force ) would eventually reverse the momentum of the ball .",0
8557,We start with the elastic collision of two objects moving along the same line — a one - dimensional problem .,0

8574,These are only two of many examples of pressures in fluids .,0
8575,"Blood pressure measurements , like tire pressures , are thus made relative to atmospheric pressure . In brief , it is very common for pressure gauges to ignore atmospheric pressure — that is , to read zero at atmospheric pressure .",0

8616,The amount of water vapor in the air depends on temperature .,0
8617,"The transfer of energy is caused by the temperature difference , and ceases once the temperatures are equal .",0
8618,These observations lead to the following definition of heat : Heat is the spontaneous transfer of energy due to a temperature difference .,1
8619,"As noted in Temperature , Kinetic Theory , and the Gas Laws , heat is often confused with temperature .",0
8620,Conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact .,1

8631,Both isothermal and adiabatic processes such as shown in [ link ] are reversible in principle .,0
8632,A reversible process is one in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path .,1
8633,"The reverse isothermal and adiabatic paths are BA and CA , respectively .",0
8634,"This question was answered at a theoretical level in 1824 by a young French engineer , Sadi Carnot ( 1796–1832 ) , in his study of the then - emerging heat engine technology crucial to the Industrial Revolution .",0
8635,"He devised a theoretical cycle , now called the Carnot cycle , which is the most efficient cyclical process possible .",0
8636,"The second law of thermodynamics can be restated in terms of the Carnot cycle , and so what Carnot actually discovered was this fundamental law .",0
8637,There is yet another way of expressing the second law of thermodynamics .,0
8638,This version relates to a concept called entropy .,0
8639,"By examining it , we shall see that the directions associated with the second law — heat transfer from hot to cold , for example — are related to the tendency in nature for systems to become disordered and for less energy to be available for use as work .",0

8645,"Simple Harmonic Motion ( SHM ) is the name given to oscillatory motion for a system where the net force can be described by Hooke ’s law , and such a system is called a simple harmonic oscillator . If the net force can be described by Hooke ’s law and there is no damping ( by friction or other non - conservative forces ) , then a simple harmonic oscillator will oscillate with equal displacement on either side of the equilibrium position , as shown for an object on a spring in [ link ] .",1
8646,"With less - than critical damping , the system will return to equilibrium faster but will overshoot and cross over one or more times .",1

8651,A system being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate .,1
8652,"The water wave in the figure also has a length associated with it , called its wavelength",0
8653,"Luckily , the rules for adding waves are quite simple . When two or more waves arrive at the same point , they superimpose themselves on one another .",0
8654,"More specifically , the disturbances of waves are superimposed when they come together — a phenomenon called superposition .",1
8655,"Each disturbance corresponds to a force , and forces add .",0
8656,"If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength , then they alternate between constructive and destructive interference .",1
8657,"The resultant looks like a wave standing in place and , thus , is called a standing wave .",0
8658,Waves on the glass of milk are one example of standing waves .,0
8659,"Therefore , the fundamental frequency is f1=vw / λ1=vw/2Lf1=vw / λ1=vw/2L size 12{f rSub { size 8{1 } } = v rSub { size 8{w } } /λ rSub { size 8{1 } } = v rSub { size 8{w } } /2`""""L """" } { } .",0

8667,"All resonant frequencies are integral multiples of the fundamental , and they are collectively called harmonics .",1
8668,"The fundamental is the first harmonic , the first overtone is the second harmonic , and so on .",0
8669,The reason is that each instrument produces a distinctive set of frequencies and intensities .,0
8670,"We call our perception of these combinations of frequencies and intensities tone quality , or more commonly the timbre of the sound .",0
8671,It is more difficult to correlate timbre perception to physical quantities than it is for loudness or pitch perception .,0
8672,Franklin wrote in his letters and books that he could see the effects of electric charge but did not understand what caused the phenomenon .,0
8673,"Today we have the advantage of knowing that normal matter is made of atoms , and that atoms contain positive and negative charges , usually in equal amounts .",0
8674,[ link ] shows a simple model of an atom with negative electrons orbiting its positive nucleus .,0
8675,The nucleus is positive due to the presence of positively charged protons .,0
8676,Some of the electrons in metals and similar conductors are not bound to individual atoms or sites in the material .,1
8677,These free electrons can move through the material much as air moves through loose sand .,0
8678,Any substance that has free electrons and allows charge to move relatively freely through it is called a conductor .,0
8679,Electrostatic repulsion in the leaves of the charged electroscope separates them .,0
8680,This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the different cell types .,0
8681,"For example , the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called macula densa , which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called juxtaglomerular cells .",0
8682,"Together , the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex ( JGC ) .",1
8683,They are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule with cilia .,0
8684,Excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore .,0

8686,Excess nitrogen is excreted from the body .,0
8687,"Nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia , which raises the pH of body fluids .",0

8689,GoutMammals use uric acid crystals as an antioxidant in their cells .,0
8690,"However , too much uric acid tends to form kidney stones and may also cause a painful condition called gout , where uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints , as illustrated in [ link ] .",1
8691,The immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses .,0
8692,Innate immunity occurs naturally because of genetic factors or physiology ; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the workload for the adaptive immune response .,1
8693,"Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins , receptor - mediated signaling , and intricate cell - to - cell communication .",0
8694,A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens .,1
8695,Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) .,0
8696,PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment .,1
8697,"A second class of early - acting cytokines is interferons , which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells .",1
8698,One of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication .,0
8699,"They also have other important functions , such as tumor surveillance .",0
8700,"Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes , and they contain organelles , called lysosomes , that digest engulfed pathogens .",1
8701,An eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite ; it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes ( parasitic worms ) .,1
8702,"Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large , darkly staining nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in [ link ] .",1
8703,"Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer ( NK ) cells , lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells ( abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue ) .",1
8704,"T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland , and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow .",1
8705,"NK cells identify intracellular infections , especially from viruses , by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class ( MHC ) I molecules on the surface of infected cells .",0
8706,"MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells , thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non - nucleated .",1
8707,Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse .,0
8708,"A granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death , or apoptosis .",1
8709,Phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind .,0
8710,"The adaptive , or acquired , immune response takes days or even weeks to become established — much longer than the innate response ; however , adaptive immunity is more specific to pathogens and has memory .",0
8711,Adaptive immunity is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination .,1
8712,This part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection .,0
8713,"The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens , and then inform the adaptive immune response about the presence of these antigens .",1
8714,"An antigen - presenting cell ( APC ) is an immune cell that detects , engulfs , and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection .",1
8715,"When a pathogen is detected , these APCs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen .",0
8716,These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will interact with and respond to an APC .,0
8717,"Naïve CD4 + cells bind APCs via their antigen - embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T ( TH ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate B cells ( or cytotoxic T cells ) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat .",1
8718,"In contrast , CD8 + cells engage antigen - embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response .",1
8719,"When a TH2 cell detects that a B cell is bound to a relevant antigen , it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly , which makes thousands of identical ( clonal ) copies of it , and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs .",0
8720,The activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection .,1
8721,"This phenomenon drastically , but briefly , changes the proportions of BCR variants expressed by the immune system , and shifts the balance toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen .",0
8722,"The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful , unnecessary responses to harmless substances , and more importantly so that it does not attack “ self . ” The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance .",1
8723,"Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that APCs of the oral cavity , pharynx , and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter .",0
8724,"A memory cell is an antigen - specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary immune response , but that can immediately become effector cells upon re - exposure to the same pathogen .",1
8725,"During the primary immune response , memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses .",0
8726,"For instance , a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor ’s blood serum .",1
8727,"This phenomenon is called passive immunity ; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding , which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to infections during the first few months of life .",0
8728,"Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region ( the surface area of about four to six amino acids ) , it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions .",0
8729,"Cross reactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion , but to a different antigen .",1
8730,"Thus , the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly .",0
8731,"Renin acts on angiotensinogen , which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II .",1
8732,"As previously discussed , antidiuretic hormone or ADH ( also called vasopressin ) , as the name suggests , helps the body conserve water when body fluid volume , especially that of blood , is low .",1
8733,It is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored and released from the posterior pituitary .,0
8734,Maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are termed hypersensitivities .,1
8735,"The types of hypersensitivities include immediate , delayed , and autoimmunity .",0
8736,Most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response .,0
8737,Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are termed autoantibodies .,1
8738,"In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis , muscle cell receptors that induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies .",0
8739,"Fission , also called binary fission , occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate , multi - celled organisms .",0
8740,"After a period of growth , an organism splits into two separate organisms .",1
8741,Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being fertilized .,1
8742,"The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid , depending on the process and the species .",0
8743,There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization .,0
8744,"In oviparity , fertilized eggs are laid outside the female ’s body and develop there , receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg .",1
8745,"This occurs in most bony fish , many reptiles , some cartilaginous fish , most amphibians , two mammals , and all birds .",0
8746,"When they are released from the ovary , they travel to the uterine tubes for fertilization .",0
8747,"Some insects have a specialized sac , called a spermatheca , which stores sperm for later use , sometimes up to a year .",1
8748,Fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival .,0
8749,"In the male reproductive system , the scrotum houses the testicles or testes ( singular : testis ) , including providing passage for blood vessels , nerves , and muscles related to testicular function .",0
8750,The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones .,1
8751,Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm ( 1.5 by 1 in ) in size and divided into wedge - shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa .,0
8752,"These are the seminal vesicles , the prostate gland , and the bulbourethral gland , all of which are illustrated in [ link ] .",0
8753,The seminal vesicles are a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder .,1
8754,"The glands make a solution that is thick , yellowish , and alkaline .",0
8755,"The bulbourethral gland , or Cowper ’s gland , releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen .",1
8756,It neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine .,0
8757,The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male .,0
8758,The labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the labia majora .,1
8759,These labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra .,0
8760,The vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes .,1
8761,It allows menstrual flow to leave the body .,0
8762,"When the reproductive hormone is required , the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) to the anterior pituitary .",0
8763,This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary into the blood .,0
8764,Note that the body must reach puberty in order for the adrenals to release the hormones that must be present for GnRH to be produced .,0
8765,"Testosterone , the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence , stimulates spermatogenesis .",1
8766,"These secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the voice , the growth of facial , axillary , and pubic hair , and the beginnings of the sex drive .",0
8767,"These include breast development , flaring of the hips , and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation .",0
8768,Progesterone assists in endometrial re - growth and inhibition of FSH and LH release .,1
8769,"To ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg , once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg membrane , the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg .",0
8770,"If this mechanism fails , multiple sperm can fuse with the egg , resulting in polyspermy .",1
8771,The resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies within a few days .,0
8772,"In mammals , the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development .",0
8773,"Here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers : the inner cell mass , and an outer layer called the trophoblast .",1
8774,The inner cell mass is also known as the embryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo .,1
8775,"The outer layers of the zygote ( blastocyst ) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells , and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue .",0
8776,"Another layer of the blastocyst , the chorion , begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin ( β - HCG ) which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active .",1
8777,This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo .,0
8778,Infertility is the inability to conceive a child or carry a child to birth .,1
8779,"About 75 percent of causes of infertility can be identified ; these include diseases , such as sexually transmitted diseases that can cause scarring of the reproductive tubes in either men or women , or developmental problems frequently related to abnormal hormone levels in one of the individuals .",0
8780,The mesoderm that lies on either side of the vertebrate neural tube will develop into the various connective tissues of the animal body .,0
8781,A spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells called somites with spaces between them .,0
8782,"The somites , illustrated in [ link ] will further develop into the ribs , lungs , and segmental ( spine ) muscle .",0
8783,Questions about conspecific interactions often focus on competition among members of the same species for a limited resource .,0
8784,Ecologists also study interactions among various species ; members of different species are called heterospecifics .,1
8785,"Examples of heterospecific interactions include predation , parasitism , herbivory , competition , and pollination .",0
8786,Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution .,1
8787,Abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation .,0
8788,The nutrients at the bottom of lakes are recycled twice each year : in the spring and fall turnover .,0
8789,The spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water ( [ link ] ) .,1
8790,These turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline : a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers .,1
8791,Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food ; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration .,1
8792,"In terrestrial environments , net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area , which is the total mass of living plants , excluding roots .",0
8793,This means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement .,0
8794,The ocean is categorized by several areas or zones ( [ link ] ) .,0
8795,All of the ocean ’s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm ( or zone ) .,1
8796,The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .,1
8797,"Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate ( approximately 200 m or 650 ft ) .",1
8798,"At depths greater than 200 m , light can not penetrate ; thus , this is referred to as the aphotic zone .",1
8799,The majority of the ocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis .,0
8800,"The water here contains silt and is well - oxygenated , low in pressure , and stable in temperature .",0
8801,Phytoplankton and floating Sargassum ( a type of free - floating marine seaweed ) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone .,1
8802,"Zooplankton , protists , small fishes , and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world ’s fisheries . Beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone ( [ link ] ) .",1
8803,"Estuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water , such as a river , meets the ocean .",1
8804,"Therefore , both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity ; mixing results in a diluted ( brackish ) saltwater .",0
8805,Abiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream .,0
8806,Streams begin at a point of origin referred to as source water .,0
8807,"The source water is usually cold , low in nutrients , and clear .",0
8808,Scientists who study climate have noted a series of marked changes that have gradually become increasingly evident during the last sixty years .,0
8809,"Global climate change is the term used to describe altered global weather patterns , including a worldwide increase in temperature , due largely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide .",1
8810,Greenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate .,0
8811,"When heat energy from the sun strikes the Earth , gases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere , as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from escaping .",0
8812,"The greenhouse gases that affect Earth include carbon dioxide , methane , water vapor , nitrous oxide , and ozone .",0
8813,"Populations consist all of the species living within a specific area , and populations fluctuate based on a number of factors : seasonal and yearly changes in the environment , natural disasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions , and competition for resources between and within species .",0
8814,"The statistical study of population dynamics , demography , uses a series of mathematical tools to investigate how populations respond to changes in their biotic and abiotic environments .",1
8815,Many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations .,0
8816,They are modeled after actuarial tables used by the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy .,0
8817,"Life tables may include the probability of individuals dying before their next birthday ( i.e. , their mortality rate ) , the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval , and their life expectancy at each interval .",1
8818,"An example of a life table is shown in [ link ] from a study of Dall mountain sheep , a species native to northwestern North America .",0
8819,"After the third hour , there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask , an increase of 4000 organisms .",0
8820,"The important concept of exponential growth is that the population growth rate — the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation — is accelerating ; that is , it is increasing at a greater and greater rate .",1
8821,"After 1 day and 24 of these cycles , the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion .",0
8822,"The value “ r ” can be positive , meaning the population is increasing in size ; or negative , meaning the population is decreasing in size ; or zero , where the population ’s size is unchanging , a condition known as zero population growth .",1
8823,"A further refinement of the formula recognizes that different species have inherent differences in their intrinsic rate of increase ( often thought of as the potential for reproduction ) , even under ideal conditions .",0
8824,The age structure of a population is an important factor in population dynamics .,0
8825,Age structure is the proportion of a population at different age ranges .,1
8826,"Age structure allows better prediction of population growth , plus the ability to associate this growth with the level of economic development in the region .",0
8827,[ link ] shows a variety of foul - tasting butterflies with similar coloration .,0
8828,"In Emsleyan / Mertensian mimicry , a deadly prey mimics a less dangerous one , such as the venomous coral snake mimicking the non - venomous milk snake .",1
8829,This type of mimicry is extremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous two types .,0
8830,"A commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from the close , prolonged interaction , while the other neither benefits nor is harmed .",1
8831,Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship ( [ link ] ) .,0
8832,A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it .,1
8833,"In this relationship , the parasite benefits , but the organism being fed upon , the host is harmed .",1
8834,The host is usually weakened by the parasite as it siphons resources the host would normally use to maintain itself .,0
8835,Other factors influence species richness as well .,0
8836,"For example , the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains , including the Galápagos Islands that inspired the young Darwin .",1
8837,"Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat , ecosystem , or biome .",1
8838,Community dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time .,1
8839,"Sometimes these changes are induced by environmental disturbances such as volcanoes , earthquakes , storms , fires , and climate change .",0
8840,Communities with a stable structure are said to be at equilibrium .,0
8841,"Eventually , over 150 years , the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire .",1
8842,"This equilibrium state is referred to as the climax community , which will remain stable until the next disturbance .",0
8843,The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new .,0
8844,"Animal behavior has been studied for decades , by biologists in the science of ethology , by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology , and by scientists of many disciplines in the study of neurobiology .",0
8845,"Although there is overlap between these disciplines , scientists in these behavioral fields take different approaches .",0
8846,"Another activity or movement of innate behavior is kinesis , or the undirected movement in response to a stimulus .",1
8847,Orthokinesis is the increased or decreased speed of movement of an organism in response to a stimulus .,1
8848,Migration is the long - range seasonal movement of animals .,1
8849,"It is an evolved , adapted response to variation in resource availability , and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals .",0
8850,Courtship displays are a series of ritualized visual behaviors ( signals ) designed to attract and convince a member of the opposite sex to mate .,1
8851,These displays are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom .,0
8852,"Thus , it is of fitness benefit for the worker to maintain the queen without having any direct chance of passing on its genes due to its sterility .",0
8853,The lowering of individual fitness to enhance the reproductive fitness of a relative and thus one ’s inclusive fitness evolves through kin selection .,1
8854,This phenomenon can explain many superficially altruistic behaviors seen in animals .,0
8855,Polygynous mating refers to one male mating with multiple females .,1
8856,"In these situations , the female must be responsible for most of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many offspring .",0
8857,ImprintingImprinting is a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species involved .,1
8858,"Hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see , their mother , and make a bond with her .",0
8859,"In operant conditioning , the conditioned behavior is gradually modified by its consequences as the animal responds to the stimulus .",1
8860,"A major proponent of such conditioning was psychologist B.F. Skinner , the inventor of the Skinner box .",0
8861,"Furthermore , some animals must expend energy caring for their offspring .",0
8862,"Thus , all species have an energy budget : they must balance energy intake with their use of energy for metabolism , reproduction , parental care , and energy storage ( such as bears building up body fat for winter hibernation).Parental Care and Fecundity",0
8863,Iteroparity describes species that reproduce repeatedly during their lives .,1
8864,"Some animals are able to mate only once per year , but survive multiple mating seasons .",0
8865,"K - selected species are species selected by stable , predictable environments .",1
8866,Populations of K - selected species tend to exist close to their carrying capacity ( hence the term K - selected ) where intraspecific competition is high .,0
8867,The ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance .,1
8868,"The speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed , called its resilience .",1
8869,Ecosystem resistance and resilience are especially important when considering human impact .,0
8870,"In many ecosystems , the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms ( plants and/or phytoplankton ) , which are called primary producers .",1
8871,The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores : the primary consumers .,1
8872,Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers .,1
8873,Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .,1
8874,"Higher - level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels , and so on , up to the organisms at the top of the food chain : the apex consumers .",1
8875,"When you are ready to create a simulation , in the upper - right corner of the Interactive Labs box , click OPEN SIMULATOR.Two general types of food webs are often shown interacting within a single ecosystem .",0
8876,"A grazing food web ( such as the Lake Ontario food web in [ link ] ) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base , followed by herbivores and various carnivores .",1
8877,"A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter ( dead organisms ) , called decomposers or detritivores .",1
8878,"A holistic ecosystem model attempts to quantify the composition , interaction , and dynamics of entire ecosystems ; it is the most representative of the ecosystem in its natural state .",1
8879,A food web is an example of a holistic ecosystem model .,0
8880,"Analytical and simulation models , in contrast , are mathematical methods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of predicting the effects of potential environmental changes without direct experimentation , although with some limitations as to accuracy .",0
8881,An analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .,1
8882,A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .,1
8883,Productivity within Trophic LevelsProductivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem incorporated into biomass in a particular trophic level .,1
8884,"Biomass is the total mass , in a unit area at the time of measurement , of living or previously living organisms within a trophic level .",1
8885,Ecosystems have characteristic amounts of biomass at each trophic level .,0
8886,Another main parameter that is important in characterizing energy flow within an ecosystem is the net production efficiency .,0
8887,Net production efficiency ( NPE ) allows ecologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular trophic level incorporate the energy they receive into biomass ; it is calculated using the following formula :,1
8888,"The structure of ecosystems can be visualized with ecological pyramids , which were first described by the pioneering studies of Charles Elton in the 1920s .",0
8889,"Ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of various parameters ( such as number of organisms , energy , and biomass ) across trophic levels .",1
8890,"Water contains hydrogen and oxygen , which is essential to all living processes .",0
8891,"The hydrosphere is the area of the Earth where water movement and storage occurs : as liquid water on the surface and beneath the surface or frozen ( rivers , lakes , oceans , groundwater , polar ice caps , and glaciers ) , and as water vapor in the atmosphere .",1
8892,Carbon is found in all organic macromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels .,0
8893,Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land ( including land beneath the surface of the ocean ) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems .,0
8894,Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within the Earth by the process of subduction : the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another .,1
8895,Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents .,0
8896,"Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) , and as rain falls through the atmosphere , sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid ( H2SO4 ) .",0
8897,Sulfur can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a process called fallout .,1
8898,"Also , the weathering of sulfur - containing rocks releases sulfur into the soil .",0
8899,"The biologists studying cichlids in the 1980s discovered hundreds of cichlid species representing a variety of specializations to particular habitat types and specific feeding strategies : eating plankton floating in the water , scraping and then eating algae from rocks , eating insect larvae from the bottom , and eating the eggs of other species of cichlid .",0
8900,The cichlids of Lake Victoria are the product of an adaptive radiation .,0
8901,"An adaptive radiation is a rapid ( less than three million years in the case of the Lake Victoria cichlids ) branching through speciation of a phylogenetic tree into many closely related species ; typically , the species “ radiate ” into different habitats and niches .",1
8902,"Many genes code for proteins , which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing .",0
8903,"Genetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells , both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism .",1
8904,"This chemical diversity has potential benefit for humans as a source of pharmaceuticals , so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and welfare .",0
8905,It is not entirely clear how greater energy input could translate into more species .,0
8906,"The complexity of tropical ecosystems may promote speciation by increasing the heterogeneity , or number of ecological niches , in the tropics relative to higher latitudes .",1
8907,"The greater heterogeneity provides more opportunities for coevolution , specialization , and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population differentiation .",0
8908,Estimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation .,0
8909,"The extinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans , especially if it has been hunted or used in some other way .",0
8910,Most fisheries are managed as a common ( shared ) resource even when the fishing territory lies within a country ’s territorial waters .,0
8911,Common resources are subject to an economic pressure known as the tragedy of the commons in which essentially no fisher has a motivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when it is not owned by that fisher .,1
8912,The natural outcome of harvests of resources held in common is their overexploitation .,0
8913,"It now appears that the global decline in amphibian species recognized in the 1990s is , in some part , caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , which causes the disease chytridiomycosis ( [ link ] ) .",0

8962,Some articles focused on her qualifications to be a potential future president or her record on the issues .,0
8963,U.S. elections are based on plurality voting .,0
8964,"Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast .",1
8965,"For instance , Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860 even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race .",0
8966,"After the election is over , supporters experience remorse when their least - favorite candidate wins instead .",0
8967,"For example , in the 2000 election , Ralph Nader ran for president as the candidate of the Green Party .",0
8968,"Nader , a longtime consumer activist concerned with environmental issues and social justice , attracted many votes from people who usually voted for Democratic candidates .",0
8969,Electoral rules are probably not the only reason the United States has a two - party system .,0
8970,"We need only look at the number of parties in the British or Canadian systems , both of which are winner - take - all plurality systems like that in the United States , to see that it is possible to have more than two parties while still directly electing representatives .",0
8971,"For example , people who describe themselves as evangelical Christians are an important Republican constituency ; they are also strongly opposed to abortion . Aaron Blake , “ The Ten Most Loyal Demographic Groups for Republicans and Democrats , ” The Washington Post , 8 April 2015 .",0
8972,"Thus , even though the majority of U.S. adults believe abortion should be legal in at least some instances , such as when a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest , or threatens the life of the mother , the position of many Republican presidential candidates in 2016 was to oppose abortion in all cases . Irin Carmon , “ GOP Candidates : Ban Abortion , No Exceptions , ” 7 August 2015 , http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-candidates-ban-abortion-no-exceptions ( March 14 , 2016 ) .",0
8973,"As a result , many women view the Republican Party as unsympathetic to their interests and are more likely to support Democratic candidates . Aaron Blake , “ The Ten Most Loyal Demographic Groups for Republicans and Democrats . ” Similarly ( or simultaneously ) , groups that have felt that the party has served their causes in the past may decide to look elsewhere if they feel their needs are no longer being met .",0
8974,"Either way , the party system will be upended as a result of a party realignment , or a shifting of party allegiances within the electorate ( [ link]).V.O .",0
8975,Key .,0
8976,That change began with the 1932 presidential campaign of Franklin Delano Roosevelt .,0
8977,"FDR determined that his best path toward victory was to create a new coalition based not on region or ethnicity , but on the suffering of those hurt the most during the Great Depression .",0
8978,"At its most basic level , being a member of the party - in - the - electorate simply means a voter is more likely to voice support for a party .",0
8979,"These voters are often called party identifiers , since they usually represent themselves in public as being members of a party , and they may attend some party events or functions .",0
8980,Party identifiers are also more likely to provide financial support for the candidates of their party during election season .,0
8981,"Second , the state organization is also responsible for drafting a state platform that serves as a policy guide for partisans who are eventually selected to public office .",0
8982,These platforms are usually the result of a negotiation between the various coalitions within the party and are designed to ensure that everyone in the party will receive some benefits if their candidates win the election .,0
8983,This has been particularly true for the Democratic Party .,0
8984,"In 1988 , the Democrats tapped Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to introduce their nominee Michael Dukakis at the convention .",0
8985,"Clinton ’s speech was lampooned for its length and lack of focus , but it served to get his name in front of Democratic voters .",0
8986,"If the issue is important enough to voters , as in the case of gun control or abortion rights , an office holder may feel his or her job will be in jeopardy if he or she too closely follows the party line , even if that means disagreeing with the executive .",0
8987,"A good example occurred when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which desegregated public accommodations and prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race , was introduced in Congress .",0
8988,"The bill was supported by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson , both of whom were Democrats .",0
8989,The problem of majority versus minority politics is particularly acute under conditions of divided government .,0
8990,Divided government occurs when one or more houses of the legislature are controlled by the party in opposition to the executive .,1
8991,"Recently , however , a new voice has emerged that has allied itself with the Republican Party .",0
8992,"Born in part from an older third - party movement known as the Libertarian Party , the Tea Party is more hostile to government and views government intervention in all forms , and especially taxation and the regulation of business , as a threat to capitalism and democracy .",0
8993,"It is less willing to tolerate interventions in the market place , even when they are designed to protect the markets themselves .",0
8994,"Scholars agree that some degree of polarization is occurring in the United States , even if some contend it is only at the elite level .",0
8995,"But they are less certain about exactly why , or how , polarization has become such a mainstay of American politics .",0
8996,The first advance came with the introduction of the “ one - person - one - vote ” principle by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1962 .,0
8997,"Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives .",0
8998,"This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes .",0
8999,Several states therefore had to make dramatic changes to their electoral maps during the next two redistricting cycles ( 1970–1972 and 1980–1982 ) .,0
9000,"Map designers , no longer certain how to protect individual party members , changed tactics to try and create safe seats so members of their party could be assured of winning by a comfortable margin .",0
9001,"The basic rule of thumb was that designers sought to draw districts in which their preferred party had a 55 percent or better chance of winning a given district , regardless of which candidate the party nominated .",0
9002,That is where political parties come in .,0
9003,"Essentially , political parties are groups of people with similar interests who work together to create and implement policies .",1
9004,They do this by gaining control over the government by winning elections .,0

9007,"The Federalist faction , led by Alexander Hamilton , largely dominated the government in the years immediately after the Constitution was ratified .",0
9008,"Included in the Federalists was President George Washington , who was initially against the existence of parties in the United States .",0
9009,"When Washington decided to exit politics and leave office , he warned of the potential negative effects of parties in his farewell address to the nation , including their potentially divisive nature and the fact that they might not always focus on the common good but rather on partisan ends .",0
9010,"In the election of 1824 , numerous candidates contended for the presidency , all members of the Democratic - Republican Party .",0
9011,Andrew Jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the Electoral College than any other candidate .,0
9012,"However , because he did not win the majority ( more than half ) of the available electoral votes , the election was decided by the House of Representatives , as required by the Twelfth Amendment .",1
9013,"One half , called simply the Democratic Party , was the party of Jackson ; it continued to advocate for the common people by championing westward expansion and opposing a national bank .",0
9014,The branch of the Democratic - Republicans that believed that the national government should encourage economic ( primarily industrial ) development was briefly known as the National Republicans and later became the Whig Party2009 .,0
9015,"“ Democratic - Republican Party , ” In UXL Encyclopedia of U.S. History , eds .",0
9016,"At various points in the past 170 years , elites and voters have sought to create alternatives to the existing party system .",0
9017,"Political parties that are formed as alternatives to the Republican and Democratic parties are known as third parties , or minor parties ( [ link ] ) .",1
9018,"In 1892 , a third party known as the Populist Party formed in reaction to what its constituents perceived as the domination of U.S. society by big business and a decline in the power of farmers and rural communities .",0
9019,"Wallace ’s campaign was a failure , largely because most people believed his policies , including national healthcare , were too much like those of communism , and this party also vanished .",0
9020,"The other third party , the States’ Rights Democrats , also known as the Dixiecrats , were white , southern Democrats who split from the Democratic Party when Harry Truman , who favored civil rights for African Americans , became the party ’s nominee for president .",1
9021,"The Dixiecrats opposed all attempts by the federal government to end segregation , extend voting rights , prohibit discrimination in employment , or otherwise promote social equality among races.“Platform of the States Rights Democratic Party , ” http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25851 ( March 12 , 2016 ) .",0

9024,"mes Madison warned of the dangers of “ factions , ” minorities who would organize around issues they felt strongly about , possibly to the detriment of the majority .",0
9025,"But Madison believed limiting these factions was worse than facing the evils they might produce , because such limitations would violate individual freedoms .",0
9026,"Largely for this reason , there is no comprehensive list of all interest groups to tell us how many there are in the United States .",0
9027,"Estimates of the number vary widely , suggesting that if we use a broad definition and include all interests at all levels of government , there may be more than 200,000.Nownes , Interest Groups in American Politics .",0
9028,"Following the passage of the Lobbying Disclosure Act in 1995 , we had a much better understanding of the number of interests registered in Washington , DC ; however , it was not until several years later that we had a complete count and categorization of the interests registered in each of the fifty states .

Newmark , Todd McNoldy , David Lowery , and Virginia Gray , “ Much of Politics is Still Local : Multistate Representation in State Interest Communities , ” Legislative Studies Quarterly 27 ( 2002 ) : 527–555 .",0
9029,Governments such as municipalities and executive departments such as the Department of Education register to lobby in an effort to maximize their share of budgets or increase their level of autonomy .,0
9030,"These government institutions are represented by a legislative liaison , whose job is to present issues to decision - makers .",0
9031,"For example , a state university usually employs a lobbyist , legislative liaison , or government affairs person to represent its interests before the legislature .",0
9032,"Many lobbyists also use outside lobbying or indirect lobbying tactics , whereby the interest attempts to get its message out to the public . Ken Kollman .",0
9033,"On the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods .",0
9034,Such collective goods are benefits — tangible or intangible — that help most or all citizens .,0
9035,The answer is that they likely prefer to do something else and realize they can receive the same grade as the rest of the group without contributing to the effort .,1
9036,"This result is often termed the free rider problem , because some individuals can receive benefits ( get a free ride ) without helping to bear the cost .",1
9037,"When National Public Radio ( NPR ) engages in a fund - raising effort to help maintain the station , many listeners will not contribute .",0
9038,"Similarly , purposive incentives focus on the issues or causes promoted by the group .",0
9039,"Someone concerned about protecting individual rights might join a group like the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) because it supports the liberties guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution , even the free expression of unpopular views.https://www.aclu.org/ ( March 1 , 2016 ) .",0
9040,"Members of the ACLU sometimes find the messages of those they defend ( including Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan ) deplorable , but they argue that the principle of protecting civil liberties is critical to U.S. democracy .",0
9041,"More recently , several shooting deaths of unarmed young African American men have raised awareness of racial issues in the United States and potential problems in policing practices .",0
9042,"In 2014 , Ferguson , Missouri , erupted in protests and riots following a decision not to indict Darren Wilson , a white police officer , in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown , who had allegedly been involved in a theft at a local convenience store and ended up in a dispute with the officer.“Hundreds of Ferguson Protesters March in Downtown D.C. , ” http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Ferguson-Protests-Planned-for-DC-Baltimore-Tuesday-283807831.html ( March 1 , 2016 ) .",0
9043,"The incident mobilized groups representing civil rights , such as the protestors in [ link ] , as well as others supporting the interests of police officers .",0
9044,"Individually , the protestors would likely have received little notice , but by joining with others , they drew substantial attention in the media and from lawmakers ( [ link ] ) .",0
9045,"While the Tea Party movement might not meet the definition of interest groups presented earlier , its aims have been promoted by established interest groups .",0
9046,"Other opportunities for participation that interest groups offer or encourage include voting , campaigning , contacting lawmakers , and informing the public about causes .",0
9047,"According to political scientists Jeffrey Berry and Clyde Wilcox , interest groups provide a means of representing people and serve as a link between them and government . See in general Jeffrey M. Berry and Clyde Wilcox .",0
9048,6562 .,0
9049,How do these observations translate into the way different interests are represented in the political system ?,0

9051,The Governmental Process : Political Interests and Public Opinion .,0
9052,"Today , the debate about interest groups often revolves around whether the First Amendment protects the rights of individuals and groups to give money , and whether government can regulate the use of this money .",0
9053,"In 1971 , the Federal Election Campaign Act was passed , setting limits on how much presidential and vice - presidential candidates and their families could donate to their own campaigns . Wright , Interest Groups and Congress : Lobbying , Contributions , and Influence ; Rozell , Wilcox , and Franz , Interest Groups in American Campaigns : The New Face of Electioneering .",1
9054,The law also allowed corporations and unions to form PACs and required public disclosure of campaign contributions and their sources .,0
9055,"In 1974 , the act was amended in an attempt to limit the amount of money spent on congressional campaigns .",0
9056,"However , at the same time , it overturned restrictions on expenditures by candidates and their families , as well as total expenditures by campaigns . Buckley v. Valeo , 75 - 436 , 424 U.S. 1 ( 1976 ) .",0
9057,"In 1979 , an exemption was granted to get - out - the vote and grassroots voter registration drives , creating what has become known as the soft - money loophole ; soft money was a way in which interests could spend money on behalf of candidates without being restricted by federal law .",1
9058,"To close this loophole , Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold sponsored the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act in 2002 to ban parties from collecting and distributing unregulated money .",0
9059,Conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch have become increasingly active in U.S. elections in recent years .,0
9060,"These brothers run Koch Industries , a multinational corporation that manufactures and produces a number of products including paper , plastics , petroleum - based products , and chemicals .",0
9061,The need to strictly regulate the actions of lobbyists became especially relevant after the activities of lobbyist Jack Abramoff were brought to light ( [ link ] ) .,0
9062,"A prominent lobbyist with ties to many of the Republican members of Congress , Abramoff used funds provided by his clients to fund reelection campaigns , pay for trips , and hire the spouses of members of Congress .",0
9063,"Large states , like Virginia , felt it would be unfair to continue with this style of legislative institution .",0
9064,"As a result , Virginia ’s delegates proposed a plan that called for bicameralism , or the division of legislators into two separate assemblies .",1
9065,"In this proposed two - chamber Congress , states with larger populations would have more representatives in each chamber .",0
9066,"The bicameral system established at the Constitutional Convention and still followed today requires the two houses to pass identical bills , or proposed items of legislation .",0
9067,"This ensures that after all amending and modifying has occurred , the two houses ultimately reach an agreement about the legislation they send to the president .",0
9068,Attempts at African American disenfranchisement continued until the civil rights struggle of the 1960s finally brought about the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .,0
9069,The act cleared several final hurdles to voter registration and voting for African Americans .,0
9070,An enumerated power is a power explicitly stated in the Constitution .,1
9071,An implied power is one not specifically detailed in the Constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government .,1
9072,"And an inherent power , while not enumerated or implied , must be assumed to exist as a direct result of the country ’s existence .",1
9073,"These include Congress ’s sole power to introduce legislation , the Senate ’s final say on many presidential nominations and treaties signed by the president , and the House ’s ability to impeach or formally accuse the president or other federal officials of wrongdoing ( the first step in removing the person from office ; the second step , trial and removal , takes place in the U.S. Senate ) .",0
9074,"Each of these powers also grants Congress oversight of the actions of the president and his or her administration — that is , the right to review and monitor other bodies such as the executive branch .",0
9075,The fact that Congress has the sole power to introduce legislation effectively limits the power of the president to develop the same laws he or she is empowered to enforce .,0
9076,"In the early days of the republic , Congress ’s role was rarely if ever disputed .",0
9077,"However , with its decision in Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) , the Supreme Court asserted its authority over judicial review and assumed the power to declare laws unconstitutional . Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. 137 ( 1803 ) .",1
9078,"Yet , even after that decision , the Court was reluctant to use this power and did n’t do so for over half a century .",0
9079,"Initially , the presidency was also a fairly weak branch of government compared with the legislature .",0
9080,His popularity and his ability to be elected four times allowed him to greatly overshadow Congress .,0
9081,"As a result , Congress attempted to restrain the power of the presidency by proposing the Twenty - Second Amendment to the Constitution , which limited a president to only two full terms in office . David M. Jordan .",0
9082,6601 .,0
9083,"Another handful of reform attempts were therefore pushed through in the wake of World War II , but then Congress neglected campaign finance reform for a few decades .",0
9084,That lull ended in the early 1970s when the Federal Election Campaign Act was passed .,0
9085,"Among other things , it created the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) , required candidates to disclose where their money was coming from and where they were spending it , limited individual contributions , and provided for public financing of presidential campaigns .",0
9086,"In the wake of the Citizens United decision , a new type of advocacy group emerged , the super PAC .",0
9087,A traditional PAC is an organization designed to raise hard money to elect or defeat candidates .,0
9088,"Political scientists have taken note of some voting patterns that appear to challenge this common assumption , however .",0
9089,"In 1960 , political scientist Angus Campbell proposed the surge - and - decline theory to explain these patterns . Angus Campbell .",0
9090,6610 .,0
9091,These are generally referred to as the majority and minority leaders .,0
9092,The minority leader has a visible if not always a powerful position .,0
9093,"As the official leader of the opposition , he or she technically holds the rank closest to that of the Speaker , makes strategy decisions , and attempts to keep order within the minority .",0
9094,"Apart from this and very few other exceptions , the president of the Senate does not actually operate in the Senate .",0
9095,"Instead , the Constitution allows for the Senate to choose a president pro tempore — usually the most senior senator of the majority party — who presides over the Senate .",0
9096,"Despite the title , the job is largely a formal and powerless role .",0
9097,"However , joint committees have no bill - referral authority whatsoever — they are informational only .",0
9098,A conference committee is used to reconcile different bills passed in both the House and the Senate .,1
9099,The conference committees are appointed on an ad hoc basis as necessary when a bill passes the House and Senate in different forms .,0
9100,"Once legislation has been proposed , however , the majority leadership consults with the parliamentarian about which committee to send it to .",0
9101,"Each chamber has a parliamentarian , an advisor , typically a trained lawyer , who has studied the long and complex rules of the chamber .",1
9102,"After the Civil War , the use of the filibuster became even more common .",0
9103,"Eventually , in 1917 , the Senate passed Rule 22 , which allowed the chamber to hold a cloture vote to end debate .",0
9104,"To invoke cloture , the Senate had to get a two - thirds majority .",0
9105,But they have largely been overshadowed by the outright ridiculous and sometimes racist filibusters of the twentieth century .,0
9106,"In the first category , the fifteen - and - a - half - hour marathon of Senator Huey Long of Louisiana stands out : Hoping to retain the need for Senate confirmation of some jobs he wanted to keep from his political enemies , Long spent much of his filibuster analyzing the Constitution , talking about his favorite recipes , and telling amusing stories , as was his custom .",0

9108,"Columbus , OH : Ohio State University Press .",0
9109,Creating and voting for an omnibus bill allows Congress to quickly accomplish policy changes that would have taken many votes and the expending of great political capital over a long period of time .,0
9110,This and successive similar uses of the budget process convinced many in Congress of the utility of this strategy .,0
9111,"Therefore , they ( and their staff members ) rely on interest groups and lobbyists to provide them with information about the technical details of policy proposals , as well as about fellow lawmakers’ stands and constituents’ perceptions .",0
9112,"These voting cues give lawmakers an indication of how to vote on issues , particularly those with which they are unfamiliar .",0
9113,"But lawmakers also rely on lobbyists for information about ideas they can champion and that will benefit them when they run for reelection . Wright , Interest Groups and Congress : Lobbying , Contributions , and Influence .",0
9114,"This means they are intended to be drawn from local populations around the country so they can speak for and make decisions for those local populations , their constituents , while serving in their respective legislative houses .",0
9115,"That is , representation refers to an elected leader ’s looking out for his or her constituents while carrying out the duties of the office . Steven S. Smith .",0
9116,"Instead , most find themselves attempting to balance the important principles embedded in each .",0
9117,Political scientists call this the politico model of representation .,0
9118,"In it , members of Congress act as either trustee or delegate based on rational political calculations about who is best served , the constituency or the nation .",1
9119,"Many advances in women ’s rights have been the result of women ’s greater engagement in politics and representation in the halls of government , especially since the founding of the National Organization for Women in 1966 and the National Women ’s Political Caucus ( NWPC ) in 1971 .",0
9120,"The NWPC was formed by Bella Abzug ( [ link ] ) , Gloria Steinem , Shirley Chisholm , and other leading feminists to encourage women ’s participation in political parties , elect women to office , and raise money for their campaigns .",0
9121,"For example , Patsy Mink ( D - HI ) ( [ link ] ) , the first Asian American woman elected to Congress , was the coauthor of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 , Title IX of which prohibits sex discrimination in education .",0
9122,"In the wake of the Civil Rights Movement , African American representatives also began to enter Congress in increasing numbers .",0
9123,"In 1971 , to better represent their interests , these representatives founded the Congressional Black Caucus ( CBC ) , an organization that grew out of a Democratic select committee formed in 1969 .",0
9124,"Founding members of the CBC include John Conyers ( D - MI ) , currently the longest - serving member of the House of Representatives , Charles Rangel ( D - NY ) , and Shirley Chisholm , a founder of the NWPC and the first African American woman to be elected to the House of Representatives ( [ link ] ) .",0
9125,The concept of collective representation describes the relationship between Congress and the United States as a whole .,1
9126,"That is , it considers whether the institution itself represents the American people , not just whether a particular member of Congress represents his or her district .",0
9127,"The Articles of Confederation made no provision for an executive branch , although they did use the term “ president ” to designate the presiding officer of the Confederation Congress , who also handled other administrative duties . Articles of Confederation , Article XI , 1781 .",0
9128,"The presidency was proposed early in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia by Virginia ’s Edmund Randolph , as part of James Madison ’s proposal for a federal government , which became known as the Virginia Plan .",0
9129,"Madison offered a rather sketchy outline of the executive branch , leaving open whether what he termed the “ national executive ” would be an individual or a set of people .",0
9130,"Alexander Hamilton ( a ) , who had served under General George Washington ( b ) during the Revolutionary War , argued for a strong executive in Federalist No .",0

9132,"To win the presidency or vice presidency , a candidate must get 270 electoral votes ( a majority ) .",0
9133,George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won by the skin of their teeth with just 271 .,0
9134,"Both , however , were living in Texas .",0
9135,Article II of the Constitution lays out the agreed - upon requirements — the chief executive must be at least thirty - five years old and a “ natural born ” citizen of the United States ( or a citizen at the time of the Constitution ’s adoption ) who has been an inhabitant of the United States for at least fourteen years . U.S .,0
9136,"Constitution , Article II , Section 1 .",0
9137,"While Article II also states that the term of office is four years and does not expressly limit the number of times a person might be elected president , after Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected four times ( from 1932 to 1944 ) , the Twenty - Second Amendment was proposed and ratified , limiting the presidency to two four - year terms .",0
9138,"In the wake of the Civil War , President Andrew Johnson faced congressional contempt for decisions made during Reconstruction .",0
9139,President Richard Nixon faced an overwhelming likelihood of impeachment in the House for his cover - up of key information relating to the 1972 break - in at the Democratic Party ’s campaign headquarters at the Watergate hotel and apartment complex .,0
9140,"Nixon likely would have also been removed by the Senate , since there was strong bipartisan consensus for his impeachment and removal .",0
9141,"No sooner had the presidency been established than the occupants of the office , starting with George Washington , began acting in ways that expanded both its formal and informal powers .",0
9142,"For example , Washington established a cabinet or group of advisors to help him administer his duties , consisting of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch .",0
9143,"Today , the heads of the fifteen executive departments serve as the president ’s advisers.https://www.justice.gov/about ( May 1 , 2016 ) .",0
9144,"And , in 1793 , when it became important for the United States to take a stand in the evolving European conflicts between France and other European powers , especially Great Britain , Washington issued a neutrality proclamation that extended his rights as diplomat - in - chief far more broadly than had at first been conceived .",0
9145,"Concerned that he might be violating the powers of the office , Jefferson rationalized that his not facing impeachment charges constituted Congress ’s tacit approval of his actions .",0
9146,James Monroe used his annual message in 1823 to declare that the United States would consider it an intolerable act of aggression for European powers to intervene in the affairs of the nations of the Western Hemisphere .,0
9147,"Later dubbed the Monroe Doctrine , this declaration of principles laid the foundation for the growth of American power in the twentieth century .",0
9148,"Of the many ways in which the chief executive ’s power grew over the first several decades , the most significant was the expansion of presidential war powers .",0
9149,"While Washington , Adams , and Jefferson led the way in waging undeclared wars , it was President James K. Polk who truly set the stage for the broad growth of this authority .",0
9150,"In 1846 , as the United States and Mexico were bickering over the messy issue of where Texas ’s southern border lay , Polk purposely raised anxieties and ruffled feathers through his envoy in Mexico .",0
9151,"Later , however , as president himself , Lincoln used presidential war powers and the concepts of military necessity and national security to undermine the Confederate effort to seek independence for the Southern states .",0
9152,"In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , Lincoln blurred the boundaries between acceptable dissent and unacceptable disloyalty .",0
9153,"He also famously used a unilateral proclamation to issue the Emancipation Proclamation , which cited the military necessity of declaring millions of slaves in Confederate - controlled territory to be free .",0
9154,"Over the course of the twentieth century , presidents expanded and elaborated upon these powers .",0
9155,"The rather vague wording in Article II , which says that the “ executive power shall be vested ” in the president , has been subject to broad and sweeping interpretation in order to justify actions beyond those specifically enumerated in the document . U.S .",0
9156,"Constitution , Article II , Section 1 .",0
9157,"As the federal bureaucracy expanded , so too did the president ’s power to grow agencies like the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .",0

9162,Neither Ronald Reagan nor Bill Clinton was especially popular with the party leadership of the Republicans or the Democrats ( respectively ) at the outset .,0
9163,"The outsider phenomenon has been most clearly demonstrated , however , in the 2016 presidential nominating process , as those distrusted by the party establishment , such as Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump , who never before held political office , raced ahead of party favorites like Jeb Bush early in the primary process ( [ link]).Senator Ted Cruz ( R - TX ) , though disliked by the party establishment , was able to rise to the top in the Iowa caucuses in 2016 because of his ability to reach the conservative base of the party .",0
9164,"Ultimately , Cruz bowed out of the race when Donald Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination in Indiana in early May 2016 .",0
9165,"Early presidential elections , conducted along the lines of the original process outlined in the Constitution , proved unsatisfactory .",0
9166,"So long as George Washington was a candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion .",0
9167,But it took some manipulation of the votes of electors to ensure that the second - place winner ( and thus the vice president ) did not receive the same number of votes .,0
9168,"In several elections , such as in 1876 and 1888 , a candidate who received less than a majority of the popular vote has claimed the presidency , including cases when the losing candidate secured a majority of the popular vote .",0
9169,"A recent case was the 2000 election , in which Democratic nominee Al Gore won the popular vote , while Republican nominee George W. Bush won the Electoral College vote and hence the presidency .",0
9170,"The 2016 election brought another such irregularity as Donald Trump comfortably won the Electoral College by narrowly winning the popular vote in several states , while Hillary Clinton collected nearly 2.9 million more votes nationwide .",0
9171,"In the immediate aftermath of the election , the incoming and outgoing administrations work together to help facilitate the transfer of power .",0
9172,"While the General Services Administration oversees the logistics of the process , such as office assignments , information technology , and the assignment of keys , prudent candidates typically prepare for a possible victory by appointing members of a transition team during the lead - up to the general election .",0
9173,"The success of the team ’s actions becomes apparent on inauguration day , when the transition of power takes place in what is often a seamless fashion , with people evacuating their offices ( and the White House ) for their successors .",0
9174,"In 2013 , President Barack Obama nominated former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel to run the Department of Defense .",0
9175,The president hoped that by nominating a former senator from the opposition he could ensure the confirmation process would go smoothly .,0
9176,"The Republican Senate and Judiciary Committee will welcome a Trump nominee in early 2017.Other presidential selections are not subject to Senate approval , including the president ’s personal staff ( whose most important member is the White House chief of staff ) and various advisers ( most notably the national security adviser ) .",0
9177,"The Executive Office of the President , created by Franklin D. Roosevelt ( FDR ) , contains a number of advisory bodies , including the Council of Economic Advisers , the National Security Council , the OMB , and the Office of the Vice President .",0
9178,"Presidents also choose political advisers , speechwriters , and a press secretary to manage the politics and the message of the administration .",0

9180,"The relevant part of Article II , Section 2 , of the Constitution reads :",0
9181,The strategy was to get the ambitious politician out of the way while still taking advantage of his popularity .,0
9182,"This scheme backfired , however , when McKinley was assassinated and Roosevelt became president ( [ link ] ) .",0
9183,"Sometimes , as in the case of Bill Clinton and Al Gore , the partnership appeared to be smooth if not always harmonious .",0
9184,"In the case of George W. Bush and his very experienced vice president Dick Cheney , observers speculated whether the vice president might have exercised too much influence .",0
9185,"Barack Obama ’s choice for a running mate and subsequent two - term vice president , former Senator Joseph Biden , was picked for his experience , especially in foreign policy .",0
9186,"Here , Lincoln poses with Union soldiers ( a ) during his visit to Antietam , Maryland , on October 3 , 1862 .",0
9187,"The inorganic material of soil consists of rock , slowly broken down into smaller particles that vary in size .",0
9188,Soil particles that are 0.1 to 2 mm in diameter are sand .,1
9189,"Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt , and even smaller particles , less than 0.002 mm in diameter , are called clay .",1
9190,"Soil distribution is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers ; together , the vertical section of a soil is called the soil profile .",1
9191,"Within the soil profile , soil scientists define zones called horizons .",0
9192,The organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material .,1
9193,"Mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock , the solid rock that lies beneath the soil , and therefore , they have a similar composition to the original rock .",1
9194,"Other soils form in materials that came from elsewhere , such as sand and glacial drift .",0
9195,"Topsoil is rich in organic material ; microbial processes occur there , and it is the “ workhorse ” of plant production .",1
9196,"The A horizon consists of a mixture of organic material with inorganic products of weathering , and it is therefore the beginning of true mineral soil .",1
9197,This horizon is typically darkly colored because of the presence of organic matter .,0
9198,"Soil bacteria , collectively called rhizobia , symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules , in which nitrogen fixation takes place .",1
9199,"This process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia , by means of the enzyme nitrogenase .",0
9200,An insectivorous plant has specialized leaves to attract and digest insects .,0
9201,"The Venus flytrap is popularly known for its insectivorous mode of nutrition , and has leaves that work as traps ( [ link ] ) .",0
9202,The male gametophyte develops and reaches maturity in an immature anther .,0
9203,"In a plant ’s male reproductive organs , development of pollen takes place in a structure known as the microsporangium ( [ link ] ) .",0
9204,"The microsporangia , which are usually bi - lobed , are pollen sacs in which the microspores develop into pollen grains .",1
9205,The female cone also has a central axis on which bracts known as megasporophylls ( [ link ] ) are present .,0
9206,"In the female cone , megaspore mother cells are present in the megasporangium .",0
9207,"Self - pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower , or another flower on the same plant .",1
9208,Cross - pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species .,1
9209,"Self - pollination occurs in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time , and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower ’s stigma .",0
9210,"Of the two sperm cells , one sperm fertilizes the egg cell , forming a diploid zygote ; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei , forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm .",1
9211,"Together , these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization ( [ link ] ) .",0
9212,"After fertilization is complete , no other sperm can enter .",0
9213,The storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots .,0
9214,"In monocots , such as corn and wheat , the single cotyledon is called a scutellum ; the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue ( xylem and phloem ) .",1
9215,Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm .,0
9216,"Tobacco ( Nicotiana tabaccum ) , tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) , and pepper ( Capsicum annuum ) are examples of endospermic dicots .",0
9217,"In non - endospermic dicots , the triploid endosperm develops normally following double fertilization , but the endosperm food reserves are quickly remobilized and moved into the developing cotyledon for storage .",0
9218,The two halves of a peanut seed ( Arachis hypogaea ) and the split peas ( Pisum sativum ) of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves .,0
9219,The portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl ( hypocotyl means “ below the cotyledons ” ) .,1
9220,"The embryonic axis terminates in a radicle ( the embryonic root ) , which is the region from which the root will develop .",1
9221,"In dicots , the hypocotyls extend above ground , giving rise to the stem of the plant .",0
9222,Forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings .,0
9223,Some seeds require vernalization ( cold treatment ) before they can germinate .,1
9224,This guarantees that seeds produced by plants in temperate climates will not germinate until the spring .,0
9225,"If the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary , it is known as a simple fruit , as seen in nuts and beans .",1
9226,"An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel , but all are in the same flower : the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit , as seen in the raspberry .",1
9227,Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers .,1
9228,"Fruits generally have three parts : the exocarp ( the outermost skin or covering ) , the mesocarp ( middle part of the fruit ) , and the endocarp ( the inner part of the fruit ) .",1
9229,"Together , all three are known as the pericarp .",0
9230,"Grafting has long been used to produce novel varieties of roses , citrus species , and other plants .",0
9231,"In grafting , two plant species are used ; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock .",0
9232,The part that is grafted or attached is called the scion .,1
9233,Layering is a method in which a stem attached to the plant is bent and covered with soil .,1
9234,Young stems that can be bent easily without any injury are preferred .,0
9235,"Soon after flowering , these plants die .",0
9236,Polycarpic plants form flowers many times during their lifetime .,1
9237,"Fruit trees , such as apple and orange trees , are polycarpic ; they flower every year .",0
9238,Limits on Animal Size and ShapeAnimals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape : this is a tubular shaped body that is tapered at both ends .,1
9239,This shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves through water and allows the animal to swim at high speeds .,0
9240,"The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur , fat , or feathers .",0
9241,The absence of insulation in ectothermic animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat .,0
9242,A sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions .,1
9243,"A midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle , making two equal right and left halves .",1
9244,A frontal plane ( also called a coronal plane ) separates the front from the back .,1
9245,"Columnar epithelial cells are taller than they are wide : they resemble a stack of columns in an epithelial layer , and are most commonly found in a single - layer arrangement .",1
9246,"The nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the digestive tract appear to be lined up at the base of the cells , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
9247,"Connective TissuesConnective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a non - living substance , called the ground substance .",1
9248,The ground substance is made of an organic substance ( usually a protein ) and an inorganic substance ( usually a mineral or water ) .,1
9249,Fibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material .,1
9250,The fibers can be arranged irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel .,0
9251,"The cells , called chondrocytes , make the matrix and fibers of the tissue .",1
9252,Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae .,0
9253,The wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi ; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells .,0
9254,Spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength .,1
9255,"Over time , these plates can break causing the bone to become less resilient .",0
9256,Any homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop .,0
9257,"It may either increase or decrease the stimulus , but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it .",0
9258,Changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system .,1
9259,This is called acclimatization .,0
9260,"This occurs , for instance , when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than it is accustomed to .",0
9261,Carnivores are animals that eat other animals .,1
9262,"The word carnivore is derived from Latin and literally means “ meat eater . ” Wild cats such as lions , shown in [ link]a and tigers are examples of vertebrate carnivores , as are snakes and sharks , while invertebrate carnivores include sea stars , spiders , and ladybugs , shown in [ link]b .",0
9263,"The alimentary canal , shown in [ link]b , is a more advanced system : it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other .",1
9264,Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal .,0
9265,"Ruminants are mainly herbivores like cows , sheep , and goats , whose entire diet consists of eating large amounts of roughage or fiber .",1
9266,They have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of cellulose .,0
9267,The lingual lipase begins the breakdown of fat components in the food .,0
9268,The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the bolus for swallowing .,0
9269,The tongue helps in swallowing — moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx .,0
9270,A ring - like muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system .,1
9271,The gastro - esophageal sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus .,0
9272,Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes .,0
9273,The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called chyme .,1
9274,Chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine .,0
9275,"The human small intestine is over 6 m long and is divided into three parts : the duodenum , the jejunum , and the ileum .",1
9276,"The “ C - shaped , ” fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in [ link ] .",1
9277,The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum .,1
9278,"Here , hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining .",0
9279,"The bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum . The ileum , also illustrated in [ link ] is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed into blood stream .",1
9280,The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle .,0
9281,The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination .,0
9282,The anus is an opening at the far - end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material .,1
9283,Two sphincters between the rectum and anus control elimination : the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary .,0
9284,The gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts .,1
9285,"When chyme containing fatty acids enters the duodenum , the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum .",0
9286,Both fat - soluble and water - soluble vitamins must be obtained from food .,0
9287,"Minerals , listed in [ link ] , are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food .",1
9288,"Among their many functions , minerals help in structure and regulation and are considered co - factors .",0
9289,"Pancreatic juices also contain amylase , which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose , a disaccharide .",1
9290,"The disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases , sucrases , and lactases , which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall .",0
9291,Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose .,0
9292,"The long - chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides , which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins .",1
9293,These large spheres are called chylomicrons .,0
9294,"Chylomicrons contain triglycerides , cholesterol , and other lipids and have proteins on their surface .",0
9295,The intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions .,0
9296,This phase controls the rate of gastric emptying .,0
9297,"Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid , or hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) which aids in the digestion of the proteins .",0
9298,"However , when the stomach is emptied , the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid .",0
9299,This is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism .,0
9300,Foods high in lipids take a long time to digest .,0
9301,A hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic movements of the intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed .,1
9302,"Once a signal is received by the dendrite , it then travels passively to the cell body .",0
9303,"The cell body contains a specialized structure , the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon .",1
9304,An axon is a tube - like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals .,1
9305,Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath .,1
9306,These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is “ recharged ” as it travels along the axon .,0
9307,Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS .,0
9308,Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .,1
9309,"Oligodendrocytes , shown in [ link]b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS .",1
9310,This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon .,0
9311,Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations .,1
9312,Ependymal cells line fluid - filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord .,1
9313,Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter .,0
9314,Transmission of a signal within a neuron ( from dendrite to axon terminal ) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential .,1
9315,"When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’s dendrites , ion channels open .",0
9316,"As K+ ions leave the cell , the membrane potential once again becomes negative .",0
9317,"The diffusion of K+ out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell , in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell 's normal resting potential .",1
9318,"At this point , the sodium channels will return to their resting state , meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential .",0
9319,"Fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft , the extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes , as illustrated in [ link ] .",1
9320,The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane .,0
9321,"Signal SummationSometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron , but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential .",1
9322,"This process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
9323,"Additionally , one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons — some excitatory and some inhibitory — so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa .",0
9324,"The central nervous system ( CNS ) is made up of the brain , a part of which is shown in [ link ] and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges ( from the Greek word for membrane ) .",1
9325,The outermost layer is the dura mater ( Latin for “ hard mother ” ) .,0
9326,The middle layer is the web - like arachnoid mater .,0
9327,"The last layer is the pia mater ( Latin for “ soft mother ” ) , which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap .",1
9328,The space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .,0
9329,"It includes the cerebral cortex , limbic system , basal ganglia , thalamus , hypothalamus , and cerebellum .",0
9330,"There are three different ways that a brain can be sectioned in order to view internal structures : a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right , as shown in [ link]b , a coronal section cuts the brain front to back , as shown in [ link]a , and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom . Cerebral CortexThe outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex , which is folded into hills called gyri ( singular : gyrus ) and valleys called sulci ( singular : sulcus ) .",1
9331,The cortex is made up of two hemispheres — right and left — which are separated by a large sulcus .,0
9332,The parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain .,0
9333,Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading .,0
9334,The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds .,1
9335,It also contains the hippocampus ( Greek for “ seahorse”)—a structure that processes memory formation .,1
9336,"The thalamus ( Greek for “ inner chamber ” ) , illustrated in [ link ] , acts as a gateway to and from the cortex .",1
9337,It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex .,0
9338,It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus .,0
9339,"One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala ( Greek for “ almond ” ) , illustrated in [ link ] .",1
9340,The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces .,0
9341,"The brainstem , illustrated in [ link ] , connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord .",1
9342,"It consists of the midbrain , medulla oblongata , and the pons .",0
9343,The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the “ fight or flight ” response that occurs when an animal encounters a dangerous situation .,1
9344,One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake ( “ snake ” and “ sympathetic ” both begin with “ s ” ) .,0
9345,"While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations , the parasympathetic nervous system allows an animal to “ rest and digest . ” One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic , the parasympathetic nervous system is in control ( “ picnic ” and “ parasympathetic ” both start with “ p ” ) .",1
9346,"Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral ( toward the bottom ) spinal cord , as shown in [ link ] .",0
9347,Neurodegenerative disorders are illnesses characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are usually caused by neuronal death .,1
9348,These diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons die .,0
9349,Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder .,1
9350,Its severity differs from person to person .,0
9351,Major depression affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one of the most common mental disorders .,1
9352,"To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder , a person must have experienced a severely depressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously enjoyed , changes in appetite and sleep schedules , difficulty concentrating , feelings of worthlessness , and suicidal thoughts .",0
9353,"Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system .",1
9354,This process is called sensory transduction . There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction .,0
9355,"In one , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus .",0
9356,The receptor can then respond to the stimuli .,0
9357,"The region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus , be it far away or in contact with the body , is that receptor ’s receptive field .",1
9358,Think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses .,0
9359,Perception is an individual ’s interpretation of a sensation .,1
9360,"Although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors , perception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor , but at higher levels in the nervous system , in the brain .",0
9361,"Meissner ’s corpuscles , ( shown in [ link ] ) also known as tactile corpuscles , are found in the upper dermis , but they project into the epidermis .",1
9362,"They , too , are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids .",0
9363,"Neurons are not physically connected , but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into synapses or “ gaps ” between communicating neurons .",0
9364,"Once in the medulla , the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus . Muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch , or lengthening of muscles .",1
9365,"Related to these are Golgi tendon organs , which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction .",1
9366,"Audition , or hearing , is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions .",1
9367,"It enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger , such as an approaching predator , and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating .",0
9368,"In mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna , then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum , the innermost part of the outer ear ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .",1
9369,Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear .,1
9370,"The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .",0
9371,The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear .,0
9372,"The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window , which is the outermost structure of the inner ear .",1
9373,"The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth , a bony , hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear .",1
9374,"The cochlea is a whorled structure , like the shell of a snail , and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) .",1
9375,"Inside the cochlea , the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea , curling toward the cochlea ’s center .",1
9376,The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti ( spiral organ ) .,1
9377,"It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil , with their exposed short , hair - like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them .",0
9378,"The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row , numbering approximately 3,500 .",0
9379,"Wave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity , or brightness .",0
9380,"The standard unit of intensity of light is the candela , which is approximately the luminous intensity of a one common candle .",1
9381,"The cornea , the front transparent layer of the eye , and the crystalline lens , a transparent convex structure behind the cornea , both refract ( bend ) light to focus the image on the retina .",1
9382,"The iris , which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye , is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye .",1
9383,"In conditions of high ambient light , the iris contracts , reducing the size of the pupil at its center .",0
9384,"For both defects , images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry .",0
9385,Myopia ( nearsightedness ) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina .,1
9386,"In this case , images in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear .",0
9387,Both rods and cones contain photopigments .,0
9388,"In vertebrates , the main photopigment , rhodopsin , has two main parts [ link ] ) : an opsin , which is a membrane protein ( in the form of a cluster of α - helices that span the membrane ) , and retinal — a molecule that absorbs light .",1
9389,"When light hits a photoreceptor , it causes a shape change in the retinal , altering its structure from a bent ( cis ) form of the molecule to its linear ( trans ) isomer .",0
9390,"Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain , where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information .",0
9391,"Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus .",0
9392,"The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body ’s internal clock , which controls our circadian ( day - long ) cycle .",1
9393,The first four tastes need little explanation .,0
9394,"The identification of umami as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recently — it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth , but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later .",0
9395,"The taste of umami , also known as savoriness , is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L - glutamate .",1
9396,Recall that sensory cells are neurons .,0
9397,"An olfactory receptor , which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron , responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain .",1
9398,"Humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors , distributed among hundreds of different receptor types that respond to different odors .",0
9399,The primary organ of taste is the taste bud .,1
9400,A taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors ( taste cells ) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae ( singular : papilla ) ( illustrated in [ link ] ) .,1
9401,There are several structurally distinct papillae .,0
9402,"Most lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
9403,The primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones .,1
9404,The structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain ( chain of amino acids ) .,0
9405,"The peptide hormones include molecules that are short polypeptide chains , such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released into the blood in the posterior pituitary gland .",0
9406,"In up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity .",1
9407,"When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced .",1
9408,"In this way , nothing passes through the cell membrane ; the hormone that binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell .",0
9409,"The hormone that initiates the signaling pathway is called a first messenger , which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm , as illustrated in [ link ] .",1
9410,"In this way , a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular product .",0
9411,"To stop hormone activity , cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme phosphodiesterase , or PDE .",0
9412,"PDE is always present in the cell and breaks down cAMP to control hormone activity , preventing overproduction of cellular products . The specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm .",1
9413,"In some cases , the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones , which is referred to as neural stimuli .",1
9414,"Recall that in a short - term stress response , the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for providing the bursts of energy required for the body to respond .",0

9733,he current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false - negative results .,0
9734,A false negative is an incorrect test result that should have been positive .,1

9736,"raditionally , microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions , which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory .",1
9737,"Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours , their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly .",0
9738,"atural selection can only take place if there is variation , or differences , among individuals in a population .",0
9739,"Importantly , these differences must have some genetic basis ; otherwise , the selection will not lead to change in the next generation .",0
9740,"owever , the wings of bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures .",0
9741,"This phenomenon is called convergent evolution , where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a common ancestry .",1

9744,"An area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce , forming hybrids , is called a hybrid zone .",1

9746,"n the gradual speciation model , species diverge gradually over time in small steps .",1
9747,"In the punctuated equilibrium model , a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species , and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward ( [ link ] ) .",1
9748,"This early change model is called punctuated equilibrium , because it begins with a punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward .",0
9749,iven the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation : the formation of two species from one original species .,1
9750,Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration found in On the Origin of Species ( [ link]a ) .,0
9751,iologists group allopatric processes into two categories : dispersal and vicariance .,0
9752,"Dispersal is when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area , and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms .",1
9753,he other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called an allopolyploid .,1
9754,"The prefix “ allo- ” means “ other ” ( recall from allopatric ) : therefore , an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine .",0
9755,"herefore , a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place ; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction .",1
9756,A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation ; this includes organisms that do n’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile .,1
9757,ehavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction from taking place .,1
9758,"For example , male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females .",0
9759,"nitially , the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur .",0
9760,But over the next few decades genetics and evolution were integrated in what became known as the modern synthesis — the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s and is generally accepted today .,1
9761,"In sum , the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes , such as natural selection , can affect a population ’s genetic makeup , and , in turn , how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species .",0
9762,he allele frequency ( or gene frequency ) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population .,1
9763,"Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms , but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change .",0
9764,"f these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population , p + q = 1 .",0
9765,"In other words , all the p alleles and all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population . But what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles , but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes , known as the population ’s genetic structure , from which scientists can surmise the distribution of phenotypes .",0
9766,"If the phenotype is observed , only the genotype of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known ; the calculations provide an estimate of the remaining genotypes .",0
9767,he diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance .,1
9768,"When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species , such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves , they try to increase a population ’s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can .",0
9769,"ver time , the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population , and the population will , as a result , grow larger on average .",0
9770,"That is , this would occur if this particular selection pressure , or driving selective force , were the only one acting on the population .",0
9771,"In other examples , better camouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure .",0
9772,nother important evolutionary force is gene flow : the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of individuals or gametes ( [ link ] ) .,1
9773,"While some populations are fairly stable , others experience more flux .",0
9774,eographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations .,0
9775,Such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant .,0
9776,"One type of geographic variation , called a cline , can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient .",1
9777,"n individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that , for example , increases the ability to reproduce ( fecundity ) , but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease , that fecundity phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age .",1
9778,"Natural selection acts at the level of the individual ; it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation , known as an organism ’s evolutionary ( Darwinian ) fitness .",1
9779,"hen the environment changes , populations will often undergo directional selection ( [ link ] ) , which selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation .",1
9780,A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth in eighteenth- and nineteenth - century England .,0
9781,"ales are often larger , for example , and display many elaborate colors and adornments , like the peacock ’s tail , while females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration .",1
9782,"Such differences are known as sexual dimorphisms ( [ link ] ) , which arise from the fact that in many populations , particularly animal populations , there is more variance in the reproductive success of the males than there is of the females .",0
9783,"That is , some males — often the bigger , stronger , or more decorated males — get the vast majority of the total matings , while others receive none .",0
9784,"n 1915 , biologist Ronald Fisher proposed another model of sexual selection : the Fisherian runaway model , which suggests that selection of certain traits is a result of sexual preference . In both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis , the trait is said to be an honest signal of the males’ quality , thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates— males that will pass the best genes to their offspring .",1
9785,any phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor .,0
9786,"Scientists call such trees rooted , which means there is a single ancestral lineage ( typically drawn from the bottom or left ) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate .",0
9787,"Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains— Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya — diverge from a single point and branch off .",0
9788, lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon .,1
9789,"When two lineages stem from the same branch point , they are called sister taxa .",1
9790,A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships .,1

9799,"he nucleus - first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ( [ link]a ) , followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria .",1
9800,"The mitochondria - first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ( [ link]b ) , which subsequently acquired a nucleus , by fusion or other mechanisms , to become the first eukaryotic cell .",1
9801,"s shown in [ link]a , some individual prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes , whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to chloroplasts .",1
9802,"This model is often called the “ web of life . ” In an effort to save the tree analogy , some have proposed using the Ficus tree ( [ link]b ) with its multiple trunks as a phylogenetic to represent a diminished evolutionary role for HGT.In the ( a ) phylogenetic model proposed by W. Ford Doolittle , the “ tree of life ” arose from a community of ancestral cells , has multiple trunks , and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has occurred .",1

9818,"The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus , which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body , and from cell damage caused by the virus .",0
9819,acteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria ( [ link ] ) .,1
9820,"When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions , the infection is said to be productive .",0
9821,"ometimes , however , a virus can remain within the cell without being released .",0
9822,"For example , when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell , it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle ( [ link ] ) , and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell .",0
9823,"When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host cell genome , it is called a prophage .",1
9824,he viral genome is then “ injected ” into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages .,0
9825,"Enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors : receptor - mediated endocytosis , or fusion .",0
9826,Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor - mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non - enveloped viruses .,0
9827,"ther viruses cause long - term chronic infections , such as the virus causing hepatitis C , whereas others , like herpes simplex virus , only cause intermittent symptoms .",0
9828,"Still other viruses , such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7 , which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola , often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host , and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection .",1
9829,"hen plants viruses are transferred between different plants , this is known as horizontal transmission , and when they are inherited from a parent , this is called vertical transmission . Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ( [ link ] ) .",1
9830,"One common symptom is hyperplasia , the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls .",1

9842,A hydrothermal vent is a breakage or fissure in the Earth ’s surface that releases geothermally heated water .,1
9843,"With the evolution of photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago , some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy source — sunlight — whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food .",0
9844,"vidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth ’s existence , the atmosphere was anoxic , meaning that there was no molecular oxygen .",1
9845,"Therefore , only those organisms that can grow without oxygen — anaerobic organisms — were able to live .",1

9850,"In a process called resuscitation , the prokaryote can go back to “ normal ” life when environmental conditions improve .",0
9851,"or example , the capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces , protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells , and makes pathogens more resistant to our immune responses .",0
9852,"Some species also have flagella ( singular , flagellum ) used for locomotion , and pili ( singular , pilus ) used for attachment to surfaces .",0
9853,"Plasmids , which consist of extra - chromosomal DNA , are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea .",0
9854,"acteria are divided into two major groups : Gram positive and Gram negative , based on their reaction to Gram staining .",0

9881,"Nitrogenase , the enzyme that fixes nitrogen , is inactivated by oxygen , so the nodule provides an oxygen - free area for nitrogen fixation to take place .",1
9882,"n order to understand eukaryotic organisms fully , it is necessary to understand that all extant eukaryotes are descendants of a chimeric organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cell(s ) of an alpha - proteobacterium that “ took up residence ” inside it .",0
9883,"This major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known as endosymbiosis , one cell engulfing another such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit .",1
9884,"Over many generations , a symbiotic relationship can result in two organisms that depend on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own .",0
9885,rotist cells may be enveloped by animal - like cell membranes or plant - like cell walls .,0
9886,Others are encased in glassy silica - based shells or wound with pellicles of interlocking protein strips .,0
9887,"The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor , preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion .",1
9888,"ntil recently , these protists were believed to lack mitochondria .",0
9889,"Mitochondrial remnant organelles , called mitosomes , have since been identified in diplomonads , but these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional .",1
9890,"Diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways , such as glycolysis , to generate energy .",1

9900,Progress in the field of fungal biology was the result of mycology : the scientific study of fungi .,1
9901,"Based on fossil evidence , fungi appeared in the pre - Cambrian era , about 450 million years ago .",0
9902,hey display two distinct morphological stages : the vegetative and reproductive .,0
9903,"The vegetative stage consists of a tangle of slender thread - like structures called hyphae ( singular , hypha ) , whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous .",1
9904,The mass of hyphae is a mycelium ( [ link ] ) .,1
9905,he hyphae in bread molds ( which belong to the Phylum Zygomycota ) are not separated by septa .,0
9906,"Instead , they are formed by large cells containing many nuclei , an arrangement described as coenocytic hyphae ( [ link]b ) .",0
9907,"ther species , such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle , are are obligate anaerobes , in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them .",1
9908,"Yeasts are intermediate , being faculative anaerobes .",0
9909,"This means that they grow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration , but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not available .",1
9910,pores allow fungi to expand their distribution and colonize new environments .,0
9911,They may be released from the parent thallus either outside or within a special reproductive sac called a sporangium .,0
9912,"lthough there are many variations in fungal sexual reproduction , all include the following three stages ( [ link ] ) .",0
9913,"First , during plasmogamy ( literally , “ marriage or union of cytoplasm ” ) , two haploid cells fuse , leading to a dikaryotic stage where two haploid nuclei coexist in a single cell .",1
9914,"During karyogamy ( “ nuclear marriage ” ) , the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus .",1
9915,he zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the Phylum Zygomycota .,1
9916,"They include the familiar bread mold , Rhizopus stolonifer , which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads , fruits , and vegetables .",0
9917,"n each ascus , two or more haploid ascospores fuse their nuclei in karyogamy .",0
9918,"During sexual reproduction , thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called the ascocarp .",1
9919,The diploid nucleus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis .,0
9920,"sexual Ascomycota and BasidiomycotaImperfect fungi — those that do not display a sexual phase — use to be classified in the form phylum Deuteromycota , , a classification group no longer used in the present , ever - developing classification of organisms .",0
9921,"While Deuteromycota use to be a classification group , recent moleclular analysis has shown that the members classified in this group belong to the Ascomycota or the Basidiomycota classifications .",0
9922,ossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history .,0
9923,"It appears that all members of this family form arbuscular mycorrhizae : the hyphae interact with the root cells forming a mutually beneficial association where the plants supply the carbon source and energy in the form of carbohydrates to the fungus , and the fungus supplies essential minerals from the soil to the plant . The glomeromycetes do not reproduce sexually and do not survive without the presence of plant roots .",1
9924,"Although they have coenocytic hyphae like the zygomycetes , they do not form zygospores .",0
9925,"ungi can affect animals , including humans , in several ways .",0
9926,A mycosis is a fungal disease that results from infection and direct damage .,1
9927,Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues .,0
9928,ne of the most remarkable associations between fungi and plants is the establishment of mycorrhizae .,0
9929,"Mycorrhiza , which comes from the Greek words myco meaning fungus and rhizo meaning root , refers to the association between vascular plant roots and their symbiotic fungi .",1
9930,Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of all plant species have mycorrhizal partners .,0
9931,ichens display a range of colors and textures ( [ link ] ) and can survive in the most unusual and hostile habitats .,1
9932,"They cover rocks , gravestones , tree bark , and the ground in the tundra where plant roots can not penetrate .",0
9933,"n both seedless and seed plants , the female gametophyte provides protection and nutrients to the embryo as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte .",1
9934,This distinguishing feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name of embryophytes .,0
9935,"fter germinating from a spore , the resulting gametophyte produces both male and female gametangia , usually on the same individual .",0
9936,"In contrast , heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores .",1
9937,"The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte .",1
9938,he spores of seedless plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin .,1
9939,This complex substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids : hence the yellow color of most pollen .,0
9940,he male gametangium ( antheridium ) releases sperm .,0
9941,Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia : the female gametangium .,0
9942,The embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte .,1
9943,"ells in green algae divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts , and their cell walls are layered in the same manner as the cell walls of embryophytes .",1
9944,"Consequently , land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta .",1
9945,he hornworts ( Anthocerotophyta ) belong to the broad bryophyte group .,0
9946,"They have colonized a variety of habitats on land , although they are never far from a source of moisture .",0
9947,he moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in [ link ] .,0
9948,"The most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte , which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonema — usually , a tangle of single - celled filaments that hug the ground .",1
9949,"Cells akin to an apical meristem actively divide and give rise to a gametophore , consisting of a photosynthetic stem and foliage - like structures .",0
9950,"he vascular plants , or tracheophytes , are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants .",1
9951,"More than 260,000 species of tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of Earth ’s vegetation .",0
9952,"hloem is the second type of vascular tissue ; it transports sugars , proteins , and other solutes throughout the plant .",1
9953,Phloem cells are divided into sieve elements ( conducting cells ) and cells that support the sieve elements .,0
9954,"icrophylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches , or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities .",0
9955,"Microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls , or “ big leaves ” , which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins .",1
9956,Megaphylls most likely appeared independently several times during the course of evolution .,0
9957,"he club mosses , or phylum Lycopodiophyta , are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants .",1
9958,"They dominated the landscape of the Carboniferous , growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests .",0
9959,"hylum Monilophyta : Class Psilotopsida ( Ferns)With their large fronds , ferns are the most readily recognizable seedless vascular plants .",0

9963,he male and female reproductive organs can form in cones or strobili .,0
9964,"Male and female sporangia are produced either on the same plant , described as monoecious ( “ one home ” or bisexual ) , or on separate plants , referred to as dioecious ( “ two homes ” or unisexual ) plants .",1
9965,The life cycle of a conifer will serve as our example of reproduction in gymnosperms .,0
9966,"emale cones , or ovulate cones , contain two ovules per scale .",0
9967,"One megaspore mother cell , or megasporocyte , undergoes meiosis in each ovule .",0
9968,"During the Middle Ages , most Europeans lived in small villages that consisted of a manorial house or castle for the lord , a church , and simple homes for the peasants or serfs , who made up about 60 percent of western Europe ’s population .",0
9969,"Hundreds of these castles and walled cities remain all over Europe ( [ link]).One of the most beautifully preserved medieval walled cities is Carcassonne , France .",0
9970,"During this period , the Roman Church became the most powerful international organization in western Europe . Just as agrarian life depended on the seasons , village and family life revolved around the Church .",0
9971,"The sacraments , or special ceremonies of the Church , marked every stage of life , from birth to maturation , marriage , and burial , and brought people into the church on a regular basis .",1
9972,"As Christianity spread throughout Europe , it replaced pagan and animistic views , explaining supernatural events and forces of nature in its own terms .",0
9973,"By the eleventh century , a major Christian holy war called the Reconquista , or reconquest , had begun to slowly push the Muslims from Spain .",1
9974,"This drive was actually an extension of the earlier military conflict between Christians and Muslims for domination of the Holy Land ( the Biblical region of Palestine ) , known as the Crusades .",1
9975,"The Inca had no system of writing , however .",0
9976,They communicated and kept records using a system of colored strings and knots called the quipu ( [ link ] ) .,1
9977,"Everywhere in the Americas , a crushing demand for labor bedeviled Europeans because there were not enough colonists to perform the work necessary to keep the colonies going .",0
9978,Spain granted encomiendas — legal rights to native labor — to conquistadors who could prove their service to the crown .,1
9979,This system reflected the Spanish view of colonization : the king rewarded successful conquistadors who expanded the empire .,0
9980,The economic philosophy of mercantilism shaped European perceptions of wealth from the 1500s to the late 1700s .,0
9981,"Mercantilism held that only a limited amount of wealth , as measured in gold and silver bullion , existed in the world .",1
9982,"As Europeans traversed the Atlantic , they brought with them plants , animals , and diseases that changed lives and landscapes on both sides of the ocean .",1
9983,These two - way exchanges between the Americas and Europe / Africa are known collectively as the Columbian Exchange ( [ link ] ) .,0
9984,"In the 1500s , Spain surpassed Portugal as the dominant European power .",0
9985,"This age of exploration and the subsequent creation of an Atlantic World marked the earliest phase of globalization , in which previously isolated groups — Africans , Native Americans , and Europeans — first came into contact with each other , sometimes with disastrous results .",1
9986,"Spain , with its New World wealth , was the bastion of the Catholic faith .",0
9987,"Beginning with the reform efforts of Martin Luther in 1517 and John Calvin in the 1530s , however , Catholic dominance came under attack as the Protestant Reformation , a split or schism among European Christians , began .",1
9988,"However , by the late 1500s , some English members of the Church began to agitate for more reform .",1
9989,"Known as Puritans , they worked to erase all vestiges of Catholicism from the Church of England .",0
9990,"At the time , the term “ puritan ” was a pejorative one ; many people saw Puritans as holier - than - thou frauds who used religion to swindle their neighbors .",0
9991,"By choosing to settle along the rivers on the banks of the Chesapeake , the English unknowingly placed themselves at the center of the Powhatan Empire , a powerful Algonquian confederacy of thirty native groups with perhaps as many as twenty - two thousand people .",1
9992,The territory of the equally impressive Susquehannock people also bordered English settlements at the north end of the Chesapeake Bay .,0
9993,The abundance of European goods gave rise to new artistic objects .,0
9994,"For example , iron awls made the creation of shell beads among the native people of the Eastern Woodlands much easier , and the result was an astonishing increase in the production of wampum , shell beads used in ceremonies and as jewelry and currency .",1
9995,"Native peoples had always placed goods in the graves of their departed , and this practice escalated with the arrival of European goods .",0
9996,The Dutch West India Company found the business of colonization in New Netherland to be expensive .,0
9997,"To share some of the costs , it granted Dutch merchants who invested heavily in it patroonships , or large tracts of land and the right to govern the tenants there .",1
9998,"In return , the shareholder who gained the patroonship promised to pay for the passage of at least thirty Dutch farmers to populate the colony .",0
9999,"The Glorious Revolution also led to the English Toleration Act of 1689 , a law passed by Parliament that allowed for greater religious diversity in the Empire .",1
10000,"This act granted religious tolerance to nonconformist Trinitarian Protestants ( those who believed in the Holy Trinity of God the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost ) , such as Baptists ( those who advocated adult baptism ) and Congregationalists ( those who followed the Puritans’ lead in creating independent churches ) .",1
10001,"While the Church of England remained the official state religious establishment , the Toleration Act gave much greater religious freedom to nonconformists .",0
10002,The Freemasons were a fraternal society that advocated Enlightenment principles of inquiry and tolerance .,1
10003,"Freemasonry originated in London coffeehouses in the early eighteenth century , and Masonic lodges ( local units ) soon spread throughout Europe and the British colonies .",0
10004,"The monarchy was dissolved , and England became a republic : a state without a king .",1
10005,"Oliver Cromwell headed the new English Commonwealth , and the period known as the English interregnum , or the time between kings , began .",1
10006,"Creating wealth for the Empire remained a primary goal , and in the second half of the seventeenth century , especially during the Restoration , England attempted to gain better control of trade with the American colonies .",1
10007,The mercantilist policies by which it tried to achieve this control are known as the Navigation Acts .,0
10008,"The Bostonians Paying the Excise - man , or Tarring and Feathering ( [ link ] ) , shows five Patriots tarring and feathering the Commissioner of Customs , John Malcolm , a sea captain , army officer , and staunch Loyalist .",1
10009,"The print shows the Boston Tea Party , a protest against the Tea Act of 1773 , and the Liberty Tree , an elm tree near Boston Common that became a rallying point against the Stamp Act of 1765 .",1
10010,"Prior to the 1764 act , colonial violations of the Navigation Acts had been tried in local courts , where sympathetic colonial juries refused to convict merchants on trial .",0
10011,"However , the Sugar Act required violators to be tried in vice - admiralty courts .",0
10012,"These crown - sanctioned tribunals , which settled disputes that occurred at sea , operated without juries .",1
10013,"In 1765 , the British Parliament moved beyond the efforts during the previous two years to better regulate westward expansion and trade by putting in place the Stamp Act .",0
10014,"As a direct tax on the colonists , the Stamp Act imposed an internal tax on almost every type of printed paper colonists used , including newspapers , legal documents , and playing cards .",1
10015,"While the architects of the Stamp Act saw the measure as a way to defray the costs of the British Empire , it nonetheless gave rise to the first major colonial protest against British imperial control as expressed in the famous slogan “ no taxation without representation . ” The Stamp Act reinforced the sense among some colonists that Parliament was not treating them as equals of their peers across the Atlantic .",0
10016,"However , Pitt was old and ill with gout .",0
10017,"His chancellor of the exchequer , Charles Townshend ( [ link ] ) , whose job was to manage the Empire ’s finances , took on many of his duties .",0
10018,Primary among these was raising the needed revenue from the colonies .,0
10019,Great Britain pursued a policy of law and order when dealing with the crises in the colonies in the late 1760s and 1770s .,0
10020,"Relations between the British and many American Patriots worsened over the decade , culminating in an unruly mob destroying a fortune in tea by dumping it into Boston Harbor in December 1773 as a protest against British tax laws .",0
10021,"The harsh British response to this act in 1774 , which included sending British troops to Boston and closing Boston Harbor , caused tensions and resentments to escalate further .",0
10022,"By the time the British withdrew from Boston , fighting had broken out in other colonies as well .",0
10023,"In May 1775 , Mecklenburg County in North Carolina issued the Mecklenburg Resolves , stating that a rebellion against Great Britain had begun , that colonists did not owe any further allegiance to Great Britain , and that governing authority had now passed to the Continental Congress .",1
10024,The resolves also called upon the formation of militias to be under the control of the Continental Congress .,0
10025,"He argued for the creation of an American republic , a state without a king , and extolled the blessings of republicanism , a political philosophy that held that elected representatives , not a hereditary monarch , should govern states .",1
10026,"The vision of an American republic put forward by Paine included the idea of popular sovereignty : citizens in the republic would determine who would represent them , and decide other issues , on the basis of majority rule .",1
10027,Republicanism also served as a social philosophy guiding the conduct of the Patriots in their struggle against the British Empire .,0
10028,The southern colonies soon became the center of the fighting .,0
10029,"The southern strategy brought the British success at first , but thanks to the leadership of George Washington and General Nathanael Greene and the crucial assistance of French forces , the Continental Army defeated the British at Yorktown , effectively ending further large - scale operations during the war .",0
10030,"Whereas the British could pay in gold and silver , the American forces relied on paper money , backed by loans obtained in Europe .",1
10031,"This first American money was called Continental currency ; unfortunately , it quickly fell in value .",0
10032,“ Not worth a Continental ” soon became a shorthand term for something of no value .,0
10033,"To many revolutionaries , especially wealthy landowners , merchants , and planters , democracy did not offer a good replacement for monarchy .",0
10034,"Indeed , conservative Whigs defined themselves in opposition to democracy , which they equated with anarchy .",0
10035,"In the tenth in a series of essays later known as The Federalist Papers , Virginian James Madison wrote : “ Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention ; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property ; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths . ” Many shared this perspective and worked hard to keep democratic tendencies in check .",0
10036,"While racial thinking permeated the new country , and slavery existed in all the new states , the ideals of the Revolution generated a movement toward the abolition of slavery .",0
10037,"Private manumissions , by which slaveholders freed their slaves , provided one pathway from bondage .",1
10038,Slaveholders in Virginia freed some ten thousand slaves .,0
10039,Pennsylvania ’s constitution also eliminated the executive branch ( there was no governor ) and the upper house .,0
10040,"Instead , Pennsylvania had a one - house — a unicameral — legislature .",1
10041,"James Madison put forward a proposition known as the Virginia Plan , which called for a strong national government that could overturn state laws ( [ link ] ) .",1
10042,"The plan featured a bicameral or two - house legislature , with an upper and a lower house .",1
10043,"The people of the states would elect the members of the lower house , whose numbers would be determined by the population of the state .",0
10044,Roger Sherman from Connecticut offered a compromise to break the deadlock over the thorny question of representation .,0
10045,"His Connecticut Compromise , also known as the Great Compromise , outlined a different bicameral legislature in which the upper house , the Senate , would have equal representation for all states ; each state would be represented by two senators chosen by the state legislatures .",1
10046,"Only the lower house , the House of Representatives , would have proportional representation .",0
10047,"In the fierce debate that erupted , the two sides articulated contrasting visions of the American republic and of democracy .",0
10048,"Supporters of the 1787 Constitution , known as Federalists , made the case that a centralized republic provided the best solution for the future .",1
10049,"Those who opposed it , known as Anti - Federalists , argued that the Constitution would consolidate all power in a national government , robbing the states of the power to make their own decisions .",1
10050,"For the national government to be effective , Hamilton deemed it essential to have the support of those to whom it owed money : the wealthy , domestic creditor class as well as foreign creditors .",0
10051,"In January 1790 , he delivered his “ Report on Public Credit “ ( [ link ] ) , addressing the pressing need of the new republic to become creditworthy .",1
10052,"He recommended that the new federal government honor all its debts , including all paper money issued by the Confederation and the states during the war , at face value .",0
10053,The events of 1793 and 1794 challenged the simple interpretation of the French Revolution as a happy chapter in the unfolding triumph of republican government over monarchy .,0
10054,"The French king was executed in January 1793 ( [ link ] ) , and the next two years became known as the Terror , a period of extreme violence against perceived enemies of the revolutionary government .",1
10055,"Revolutionaries advocated direct representative democracy , dismantled Catholicism , replaced that religion with a new philosophy known as the Cult of the Supreme Being , renamed the months of the year , and relentlessly employed the guillotine against their enemies .",0
10056,"One of Adams ’s appointees , William Marbury , had been selected to be a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia , and when his commission did not arrive , he petitioned the Supreme Court for an explanation from Jefferson ’s secretary of state , James Madison .",0
10057,"In deciding the case , Marbury v. Madison , in 1803 , Chief Justice John Marshall agreed that Marbury had the right to a legal remedy , establishing that individuals had rights even the president of the United States could not abridge .",0
10058,"However , Marshall also found that Congress ’s Judicial Act of 1789 , which would have given the Supreme Court the power to grant Marbury remedy , was unconstitutional because the Constitution did not allow for cases like Marbury ’s to come directly before the Supreme Court .",0
10059,"New Orleans and the vast Mississippi River Valley had been successfully defended , ensuring the future of American settlement and commerce .",0
10060,"The Battle of New Orleans immediately catapulted Jackson to national prominence as a war hero , and in the 1820s , he emerged as the head of the new Democratic Party .",0
10061,"Workers were organized the way that they had been in English factories , in family units .",0
10062,"Under the “ Rhode Island system , ” families were hired .",1
10063,"The father was placed in charge of the family unit , and he directed the labor of his wife and children .",0
10064,"In Philadelphia , New York , and Boston — all cities that experienced dizzying industrial growth during the nineteenth century — workers united to form political parties .",0
10065,"Thomas Skidmore , from Connecticut , was the outspoken organizer of the Working Men ’s Party , which lodged a radical protest against the exploitation of workers that accompanied industrialization .",1
10066,Skidmore took his cue from Thomas Paine and the American Revolution to challenge the growing inequity in the United States .,0
10067,"Even short waterways , such as the two - and - a - half - mile canal going around the rapids of the Ohio River near Louisville , Kentucky , proved a huge leap forward , in this case by opening a water route from Pittsburgh to New Orleans .",0
10068,"The preeminent example was the Erie Canal ( [ link ] ) , which linked the Hudson River , and thus New York City and the Atlantic seaboard , to the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River Valley .",1
10069,"Before the 1820s , a code of deference had underwritten the republic ’s political order .",0
10070,"Deference was the practice of showing respect for individuals who had distinguished themselves through military accomplishments , educational attainment , business success , or family pedigree .",1
10071,"In this way , Van Buren helped create a political machine of disciplined party members who prized loyalty above all else , a harbinger of future patronage politics in the United States .",1
10072,"This system of rewarding party loyalists is known as the spoils system ( from the expression , “ To the victor belong the spoils ” ) .",0
10073,Van Buren ’s political machine helped radically transform New York politics .,0
10074,"The tariff raised questions about how power should be distributed , causing a fiery debate between those who supported states’ rights and those who supported the expanded power of the federal government ( [ link ] ) .",0
10075,"Those who championed states’ rights denounced the 1828 measure as the Tariff of Abominations , clear evidence that the federal government favored one region , in this case the North , over another , the South .",0
10076,They made their case by pointing out that the North had an expanding manufacturing base while the South did not .,0
10077,"Calhoun fell out of favor with President Jackson , who defended Peggy Eaton and derided those who would not socialize with her , declaring she was “ as chaste as a virgin . ” ( Jackson had personal reasons for defending Eaton : he drew a parallel between Eaton ’s treatment and that of his late wife , Rachel , who had been subjected to attacks on her reputation related to her first marriage , which had ended in divorce . )",0
10078,"Martin Van Buren , who defended the Eatons and organized social gatherings with them , became close to Jackson , who came to rely on a group of informal advisers that included Van Buren and was dubbed the Kitchen Cabinet .",0
10079,This select group of presidential supporters highlights the importance of party loyalty to Jackson and the Democratic Party .,0
10080,"Jackson ’s veto of the bank and his Specie Circular helped galvanize opposition forces into a new political party , the Whigs , a faction that began to form in 1834 .",0
10081,"The name was significant ; opponents of Jackson saw him as exercising tyrannical power , so they chose the name Whig after the eighteenth - century political party that resisted the monarchical power of King George III .",0
10082,"In a series of forced marches , some fifteen thousand Cherokee were finally relocated to Oklahoma .",1
10083,"This forced migration , known as the Trail of Tears , caused the deaths of as many as four thousand Cherokee ( [ link ] ) .",0
10084,"The Creek , Choctaw , Chickasaw , and Seminole peoples were also compelled to go .",0
10085,The campaign thrust Harrison into the national spotlight .,0
10086,"Democrats tried to discredit him by declaring , “ Give him a barrel of hard [ alcoholic ] cider and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him , and take my word for it , he will sit the remainder of his days in his log cabin . ” The Whigs turned the slur to their advantage by presenting Harrison as a man of the people who had been born in a log cabin ( in fact , he came from a privileged background in Virginia ) , and the contest became known as the log cabin campaign ( [ link ] ) .",0
10087,"At Whig political rallies , the faithful were treated to whiskey made by the E. C. Booz Company , leading to the introduction of the word “ booze ” into the American lexicon .",0
10088,"The Adams - Onís Treaty upset many American expansionists , who criticized Adams for not laying claim to all of Texas , which they believed had been included in the Louisiana Purchase .",0
10089,"In the summer of 1819 , James Long , a planter from Natchez , Mississippi , became a filibuster , or a private , unauthorized military adventurer , when he led three hundred men on an expedition across the Sabine River to take control of Texas .",1
10090,"Long ’s men succeeded in capturing Nacogdoches , writing a Declaration of Independence ( see below ) , and setting up a republican government .",0
10091,"After the 1819 Adams - Onís Treaty defined the U.S .- Mexico boundary , the Spanish Mexican government began actively encouraging Americans to settle their northern province .",1
10092,"Texas was sparsely settled , and the few Mexican farmers and ranchers who lived there were under constant threat of attack by hostile Indian tribes , especially the Comanche , who supplemented their hunting with raids in pursuit of horses and cattle . To increase the non - Indian population in Texas and provide a buffer zone between its hostile tribes and the rest of Mexico , Spain began to recruit empresarios .",0
10093,An empresario was someone who brought settlers to the region in exchange for generous grants of land .,1
10094,"Like Spain , Mexico also wished to encourage settlement in the state of Coahuila y Texas and passed colonization laws to encourage immigration .",0
10095,"Thousands of Americans , primarily from slave states , flocked to Texas and quickly came to outnumber the Tejanos , the Mexican residents of the region .",1
10096,The soil and climate offered good opportunities to expand slavery and the cotton kingdom .,0
10097,"Indeed , Mexico refused even to acknowledge Polk ’s emissary , John Slidell , who had been sent to Mexico City to negotiate .",0
10098,"Not to be deterred , Polk encouraged Thomas O. Larkin , the U.S. consul in Monterey , to assist any American settlers and any Californios , the Mexican residents of the state , who wished to proclaim their independence from Mexico .",0
10099,"By the end of 1845 , having broken diplomatic ties with the United States over Texas and having grown alarmed by American actions in California , the Mexican government warily anticipated the next move .",0
10100,"Once in California , gathered in camps with names like Drunkard ’s Bar , Angel ’s Camp , Gouge Eye , and Whiskeytown , the “ forty - niners ” did not find wealth so easy to come by as they had first imagined .",0
10101,"Although some were able to find gold by panning for it or shoveling soil from river bottoms into sieve - like contraptions called rockers , most did not .",1
10102,Would they pledge to support it ?,0
10103,"At the party ’s New York State convention in Buffalo , Martin Van Buren ’s antislavery supporters — called Barnburners because they were likened to farmers who were willing to burn down their own barn to get rid of a rat infestation — spoke in favor of the proviso .",1
10104,"Their opponents , known as Hunkers , refused to support it .",0
10105,The Compromise of 1850 brought temporary relief .,0
10106,It resolved the issue of slavery in the territories for the moment and prevented secession .,0
10107,"Almost no cotton was grown in the United States in 1787 , the year the federal constitution was written .",0
10108,"However , following the War of 1812 , a huge increase in production resulted in the so - called cotton boom , and by midcentury , cotton became the key cash crop ( a crop grown to sell rather than for the farmer ’s sole use ) of the southern economy and the most important American commodity .",1
10109,"By 1850 , of the 3.2 million slaves in the country ’s fifteen slave states , 1.8 million were producing cotton ; by 1860 , slave labor was producing over two billion pounds of cotton per year .",0
10110,"White men invested substantial sums in slaves , carefully calculating the annual returns they could expect from a slave as well as the possibility of greater profits through natural increase .",0
10111,"The domestic slave trade was highly visible , and like the infamous Middle Passage that brought captive Africans to the Americas , it constituted an equally disruptive and horrifying journey now called the second middle passage .",0
10112,"Between 1820 and 1860 , white American traders sold a million or more slaves in the domestic slave market .",0
10113,"In 1854 , American diplomats met in Ostend , Belgium , to find a way to gain Cuba .",0
10114,"They wrote a secret memo , known as the Ostend Manifesto ( thought to be penned by James Buchanan , who was elected president two years later ) , stating that if Spain refused to sell Cuba to the United States , the United States was justified in taking the island as a national security measure .",1
10115,The thousands swept up in the movement believed in the possibility of creating a much better world .,0
10116,"Many adopted millennialism , the fervent belief that the Kingdom of God would be established on earth and that God would reign on earth for a thousand years , characterized by harmony and Christian morality .",1
10117,"Those drawn to the message of the Second Great Awakening yearned for stability , decency , and goodness in the new and turbulent American republic .",0
10118,German Protestant migrants formed several pietistic societies : communities that stressed transformative individual religious experience or piety over religious rituals and formality .,1
10119,"One of the earliest of these , the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania , was founded by a charismatic leader named Conrad Beissel in the 1730s .",0
10120,"During the late 1820s , Smith translated the writing on the golden plates , and in 1830 , he published his finding as The Book of Mormon .",0
10121,"That same year , he organized the Church of Christ , the progenitor of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints popularly known as Mormons .",1
10122,"He presented himself as a prophet and aimed to recapture what he viewed as the purity of the primitive Christian church , purity that had been lost over the centuries . Smith emphasized the importance of families being led by fathers .",0
10123,"However , temperance enjoyed a revival in the 1840s , as a new type of reformer took up the cause against alcohol .",0
10124,"The engine driving the new burst of enthusiastic temperance reform was the Washington Temperance Society ( named in deference to George Washington ) , which organized in 1840 .",0
10125,The leaders of the Washingtonians came not from the ranks of Protestant ministers but from the working class .,0
10126,"An early and popular “ reform ” to slavery was colonization , or a movement advocating the displacement of African Americans out of the country , usually to Africa .",1
10127,"In 1816 , the Society for the Colonization of Free People of Color of America ( also called the American Colonization Society or ACS ) was founded with this goal .",0
10128,Garrison also preached immediatism : the moral demand to take immediate action to end slavery .,1
10129,He wrote of equal rights and demanded that blacks be treated as equal to whites .,0
10130,"The operation of the law further alarmed northerners and confirmed for many the existence of a “ Slave Power ” — that is , a minority of elite slaveholders who wielded a disproportionate amount of power over the federal government , shaping domestic and foreign policies to suit their interests .",1
10131,"Despite southerners’ repeated insistence on states’ rights , the Fugitive Slave Act showed that slaveholders were willing to use the power of the federal government to bend people in other states to their will .",0
10132,"The Democrats divided along sectional lines as a result of the bill , and the Whig party , in decline in the early 1850s , found its political power slipping further .",0
10133,"Most important , the Kansas - Nebraska Act gave rise to the Republican Party , a new political party that attracted northern Whigs , Democrats who shunned the Kansas - Nebraska Act , members of the Free - Soil Party , and assorted abolitionists .",0
10134,"Indeed , with the formation of the Republican Party , the Free - Soil Party ceased to exist .",0
10135,The electoral contest in 1856 took place in a transformed political landscape .,0
10136,"A third political party appeared : the anti - immigrant American Party , a formerly secretive organization with the nickname “ the Know - Nothing Party ” because its members denied knowing anything about it .",0
10137,"By 1856 , the American or Know - Nothing Party had evolved into a national force committed to halting further immigration .",0
10138,"Douglas responded to Lincoln during the second debate at Freeport , Illinois .",0
10139,"In what became known as the Freeport Doctrine , Douglas adamantly upheld popular sovereignty , declaring : “ It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under the Constitution , the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please . ” The Freeport Doctrine antagonized southerners and caused a major rift in the Democratic Party .",1
10140,"The doctrine did help Douglas in Illinois , however , where most voters opposed the further expansion of slavery .",0
10141,"Despite the ruptures and tensions , by the 1860s , some hope of healing the nation still existed .",0
10142,"Before Lincoln took office , John Crittenden , a senator from Kentucky who had helped form the Constitutional Union Party during the 1860 presidential election , attempted to defuse the explosive situation by offering six constitutional amendments and a series of resolutions , known as the Crittenden Compromise .",0
10143,"Crittenden ’s goal was to keep the South from seceding , and his strategy was to transform the Constitution to explicitly protect slavery forever .",0
10144,"Meanwhile , Lincoln and military leaders in the North hoped a quick blow to the South , especially if they could capture the Confederacy ’s new capital of Richmond , Virginia , would end the rebellion before it went any further .",0
10145,"On July 21 , 1861 , the two armies met near Manassas , Virginia , along Bull Run Creek , only thirty miles from Washington , DC .",0
10146,"So great was the belief that this would be a climactic Union victory that many Washington socialites and politicians brought picnic lunches to a nearby area , hoping to witness history unfolding before them .",0
10147,"The Union army ’s inability to destroy Lee ’s army at Antietam made it clear to Lincoln that McClellan would never win the war , and the president was forced to seek a replacement .",0
10148,Lincoln wanted someone who could deliver a decisive Union victory .,0
10149,"Over the objections of slaveholders , it impressed slaves , seizing these workers from their owners and forcing them to work on fortifications and rail lines .",0
10150,"Concerned about the resistance to and unhappiness with the government measures , in 1862 , the Confederate Congress gave President Davis the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus , the right of those arrested to be brought before a judge or court to determine whether there is cause to hold the prisoner .",1
10151,"With a stated goal of bolstering national security in the fledgling republic , this change meant that the Confederacy could arrest and detain indefinitely any suspected enemy without giving a reason .",0
10152,"Since the beginning of the war , thousands of slaves had fled to the safety of Union lines .",1
10153,"In May 1861 , Union general Benjamin Butler and others labeled these refugees from slavery contrabands .",0
10154,"Butler reasoned that since Southern states had left the United States , he was not obliged to follow federal fugitive slave laws .",0
10155,"In keeping with the logic of total war , Sherman ’s forces cut a swath of destruction to Savannah .",0
10156,"On Sherman ’s March to the Sea , the Union army , seeking to demoralize the South , destroyed everything in its path , despite strict instructions regarding the preservation of civilian property .",1
10157,"Although towns were left standing , houses and barns were burned .",0
10158,"The end of the Civil War saw the beginning of the Reconstruction era , when former rebel Southern states were integrated back into the Union .",1
10159,President Lincoln moved quickly to achieve the war ’s ultimate goal : reunification of the country .,0
10160,"In February 1864 , two of the Radical Republicans , Ohio senator Benjamin Wade and Maryland representative Henry Winter Davis , answered Lincoln with a proposal of their own .",0
10161,"Among other stipulations , the Wade - Davis Bill called for a majority of voters and government officials in Confederate states to take an oath , called the Ironclad Oath , swearing that they had never supported the Confederacy or made war against the United States .",1
10162,Those who could not or would not take the oath would be unable to take part in the future political life of the South .,0
10163,"In this endeavor , the Freedmen ’s Bureau received support from Christian organizations that had long advocated for abolition , such as the American Missionary Association ( AMA ) .",0
10164,The AMA used the knowledge and skill it had acquired while working in missions in Africa and with American Indian groups to establish and run schools for freed slaves in the postwar South .,1
10165,"The 1867 Military Reconstruction Act , which encompassed the vision of Radical Republicans , set a new direction for Reconstruction in the South .",0
10166,"Republicans saw this law , and three supplementary laws passed by Congress that year , called the Reconstruction Acts , as a way to deal with the disorder in the South .",0
10167,The 1867 act divided the ten southern states that had yet to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment into five military districts ( Tennessee had already been readmitted to the Union by this time and so was excluded from these acts ) .,0
10168,"While they no longer faced relentless toil under the lash , freed people emerged from slavery without any money and needed farm implements , food , and other basic necessities to start their new lives .",0
10169,"Under the crop - lien system , store owners extended credit to farmers under the agreement that the debtors would pay with a portion of their future harvest .",1
10170,"However , the creditors charged high interest rates , making it even harder for freed people to gain economic independence .",0
10171,"Despite the great variety in Klan membership , on the whole , the group tended to direct its attention toward persecuting freed people and people they considered carpetbaggers , a term of abuse applied to northerners accused of having come to the South to acquire wealth through political power at the expense of southerners .",1
10172,"The colorful term captured the disdain of southerners for these people , reflecting the common assumption that these men , sensing great opportunity , packed up all their worldly possessions in carpetbags , a then - popular type of luggage , and made their way to the South .",1
10173,"Many white southerners felt humiliated by the process of Radical Reconstruction and the way Republicans had upended southern society , placing blacks in positions of authority while taxing large landowners to pay for the education of former slaves .",0
10174,"Those committed to rolling back the tide of Radical Reconstruction in the South called themselves redeemers , a label that expressed their desire to redeem their states from northern control and to restore the antebellum social order whereby blacks were kept safely under the boot heel of whites .",1
10175,"They represented the Democratic Party in the South and worked tirelessly to end what they saw as an era of “ negro misrule . ” By 1877 , they had succeeded in bringing about the “ redemption ” of the South , effectively destroying the dream of Radical Reconstruction .",0
10176,"The Homestead Act allowed any head of household , or individual over the age of twenty - one — including unmarried women — to receive a parcel of 160 acres for only a nominal filing fee .",1
10177,All that recipients were required to do in exchange was to “ improve the land ” within a period of five years of taking possession .,0
10178,"Similar advancements in hay mowers , manure spreaders , and threshing machines greatly improved farm production for those who could afford them .",0
10179,"Where capital expense became a significant factor , larger commercial farms — known as “ bonanza farms ” — began to develop .",1
10180,"Farmers in Minnesota , North Dakota , and South Dakota hired migrant farmers to grow wheat on farms in excess of twenty thousand acres each .",0
10181,"One example of the violence that bubbled up was the infamous Fence Cutting War in Clay County , Texas ( 1883–1884 ) .",0
10182,"There , cowboys began destroying fences that several ranchers erected along public lands : land they had no right to enclose .",0
10183,A more effective means with which to address the public perception of the “ Indian threat ” was needed .,0
10184,Americanization provided the answer .,0
10185,"Although Thomas Alva Edison ( [ link ] ) is best known for his contributions to the electrical industry , his experimentation went far beyond the light bulb .",0
10186,"Edison was quite possibly the greatest inventor of the turn of the century , saying famously that he “ hoped to have a minor invention every ten days and a big thing every month or so . ” He registered 1,093 patents over his lifetime and ran a world - famous laboratory , Menlo Park , which housed a rotating group of up to twenty - five scientists from around the globe .",0
10187,Rockefeller was ruthless in his pursuit of total control of the oil refining business .,0
10188,"As other entrepreneurs flooded the area seeking a quick fortune , Rockefeller developed a plan to crush his competitors and create a true monopoly in the refining industry .",0
10189,"Beginning in 1872 , he forged agreements with several large railroad companies to obtain discounted freight rates for shipping his product .",0
10190,"In order to control the variety of interests he now maintained in industry , Rockefeller created a new legal entity , known as a trust .",0
10191,"In this arrangement , a small group of trustees possess legal ownership of a business that they operate for the benefit of other investors .",1
10192,"In the 1870s , Irish coal miners in eastern Pennsylvania formed a secret organization known as the Molly Maguires , named for the famous Irish patriot .",1
10193,"Through a series of scare tactics that included kidnappings , beatings , and even murder , the Molly Maguires sought to bring attention to the miners’ plight , as well as to cause enough damage and concern to the mine owners that the owners would pay attention to their concerns .",0
10194,Churches and civic organizations provided some relief to the challenges of working - class city life .,0
10195,Churches were moved to intervene through their belief in the concept of the social gospel .,0
10196,"This philosophy stated that all Christians , whether they were church leaders or social reformers , should be as concerned about the conditions of life in the secular world as the afterlife , and the Reverend Washington Gladden was a major advocate .",1
10197,"One example of a machine political system was the Democratic political machine Tammany Hall in New York , run by machine boss William Tweed with assistance from George Washington Plunkitt ( [ link ] ) .",0
10198,"There , citizens knew their immediate problems would be addressed in return for their promise of political support in future elections .",0
10199,"While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of funds to find anyplace better , and the wealthy class chose to remain in the cities to stay close to the action of big business transactions , the emerging middle class responded to urban challenges with their own solutions .",0
10200,"This group included the managers , salesmen , engineers , doctors , accountants , and other salaried professionals who still worked for a living , but were significantly better educated and compensated than the working - class poor .",0
10201,"Political philosopher Herbert Spencer took Darwin ’s theory of evolution further , coining the actual phrase “ survival of the fittest , ” and later helping to popularize the phrase social Darwinism to posit that society evolved much like a natural organism , wherein some individuals will succeed due to racially and ethnically inherent traits , and their ability to adapt .",1
10202,The adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks .,0
10203,"These layers form three distinct regions : an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids , a middle zona fasciculata that produces glucocorticoids , and an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens .",0
10204,"The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans , as visible in the micrograph shown in [ link ] .",1
10205,"The pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types : alpha cells , which produce the hormone glucagon , and beta cells , which produce the hormone insulin .",0
10206,"While the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major endocrine glands , the kidneys themselves also possess endocrine function .",0
10207,Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone .,0
10208,"As blood osmolarity decreases , a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus , and ADH secretion is reduced .",0
10209,"ADH release can be reduced by certain substances , including alcohol , which can cause increased urine production and dehydration . Chronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus .",0
10210,"If the posterior pituitary does not release enough ADH , water can not be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine .",0
10211,"FSH production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin , which is released by the testes .",0
10212,LH stimulates production of the sex hormones ( androgens ) by the interstitial cells of the testes and therefore is also called interstitial cell - stimulating hormone .,0
10213,"Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin - releasing hormone ( PRH ) and prolactin - inhibiting hormone ( PIH ) , which is now known to be dopamine .",0
10214,"PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it . The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin , which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth .",0
10215,The uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks .,0
10216,"This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas , or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin .",0
10217,"This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells , causing high levels of blood glucose , or hyperglycemia ( high sugar ) .",1
10218,"High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine , resulting in glucose being lost in urine .",0
10219,"When blood glucose levels decline below normal levels , for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during exercise , the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas .",0
10220,"Glucagon raises blood glucose levels , eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect , by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis .",1
10221,Glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and released into circulation by the liver cells .,0
10222,"T3 and T4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary .",0
10223,TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T3 and T4 from a glycoprotein called thyroglobulin .,0
10224,Disorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones .,0
10225,"Hypothyroidism , underproduction of the thyroid hormones , can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain , sensitivity to cold , and reduced mental activity , among other symptoms .",1
10226,"In children , hypothyroidism can cause cretinism , which can lead to mental retardation and growth defects .",0
10227,"The hormone calcitonin , which is produced by the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid , has the opposite effect on blood calcium levels as does PTH .",0
10228,"Calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts , stimulating osteoblasts , and stimulating calcium excretion by the kidneys .",1
10229,Blood glucose levels increase as most tissues are utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs .,0
10230,"The GH mediated increase in blood glucose levels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose levels seen in diabetes mellitus . The indirect mechanism of GH action is mediated by insulin - like growth factors ( IGFs ) or somatomedins , which are a family of growth - promoting proteins produced by the liver , which stimulates tissue growth .",1
10231,"IGFs stimulate the uptake of amino acids from the blood , allowing the formation of new proteins , particularly in skeletal muscle cells , cartilage cells , and other target cells , as shown in [ link ] .",0
10232,"In some cases , individuals are under 30 inches in height .",0
10233,"Oversecretion of growth hormone can lead to gigantism in children , causing excessive growth .",0
10234,"In some documented cases , individuals can reach heights of over eight feet .",0
10235,"Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla ( which mediates short - term stress responses ) via nerve impulses , and the adrenal cortex , which mediates long - term stress responses , via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary . Short - term Stress ResponseWhen presented with a stressful situation , the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy .",1
10236,The hormones epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( also known as noradrenaline ) are released by the adrenal medulla .,0
10237,How do these hormones provide a burst of energy ?,0
10238,"FSH stimulates egg maturation in females , while LH stimulates the production of estrogens and progesterone .",0
10239,Estrogens are a group of steroid hormones produced by the ovaries that trigger the development of secondary sex characteristics in females as well as control the maturation of the ova .,1
10240,"In females , the pituitary also produces prolactin , which stimulates milk production after childbirth , and oxytocin , which stimulates uterine contraction during childbirth and milk let - down during suckling . Insulin is produced by the pancreas in response to rising blood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize blood glucose and store excess glucose for later use .",1
10241,"An endoskeleton is a skeleton that consists of hard , mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of organisms .",1
10242,An example of a primitive endoskeletal structure is the spicules of sponges .,0
10243,"The skull consists of 22 bones , which are divided into two categories : cranial bones and facial bones .",0
10244,"The cranial bones are eight bones that form the cranial cavity , which encloses the brain and serves as an attachment site for the muscles of the head and neck .",1
10245,"The eight cranial bones are the frontal bone , two parietal bones , two temporal bones , occipital bone , sphenoid bone , and the ethmoid bone .",0
10246,"Although it is not found in the skull , the hyoid bone is considered a component of the axial skeleton .",0
10247,The hyoid bone lies below the mandible in the front of the neck .,1
10248,"It acts as a movable base for the tongue and is connected to muscles of the jaw , larynx , and tongue .",0
10249,"The thoracic cage , also known as the ribcage , is the skeleton of the chest , and consists of the ribs , sternum , thoracic vertebrae , and costal cartilages ( [ link ] ) .",1
10250,"The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity , including the heart and lungs .",0
10251,The appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the upper limbs ( which function to grasp and manipulate objects ) and the lower limbs ( which permit locomotion ) .,0
10252,"It also includes the pectoral girdle , or shoulder girdle , that attaches the upper limbs to the body , and the pelvic girdle that attaches the lower limbs to the body ( [ link ] ) .",0
10253,"The scapulae are flat , triangular bones that are located at the back of the pectoral girdle .",1
10254,They support the muscles crossing the shoulder joint .,0
10255,It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow .,0
10256,The forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones : the ulna and the radius .,1
10257,The radius is located along the lateral ( thumb ) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow .,1
10258,"The radius and ulna also articulate with the carpal bones and with each other , which in vertebrates enables a variable degree of rotation of the carpus with respect to the long axis of the limb .",0
10259,"The hand includes the eight bones of the carpus ( wrist ) , the five bones of the metacarpus ( palm ) , and the 14 bones of the phalanges ( digits ) .",0
10260,"Each digit consists of three phalanges , except for the thumb , when present , which has only two .",0
10261,"The lower limb consists of the thigh , the leg , and the foot .",1
10262,"The bones of the lower limb are the femur ( thigh bone ) , patella ( kneecap ) , tibia and fibula ( bones of the leg ) , tarsals ( bones of the ankle ) , and metatarsals and phalanges ( bones of the foot ) ( [ link ] ) .",1
10263,It improves knee extension by reducing friction .,0
10264,"The tibia , or shinbone , is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee .",1
10265,"The tibia articulates with the femur at its proximal end , with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end .",0
10266,The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot .,0
10267,The metatarsals are the five bones of the foot .,1
10268,The phalanges are the 14 bones of the toes .,1
10269,"There are three types of fibrous joints : sutures , syndesmoses , and gomphoses .",0
10270,Sutures are found only in the skull and possess short fibers of connective tissue that hold the skull bones tightly in place ( [ link ] ) .,1
10271,Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage .,1
10272,There are two types of cartilaginous joints : synchondroses and symphyses .,0
10273,Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones ( [ link ] ) . This space is referred to as the synovial ( or joint ) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid .,1
10274,"Amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement , including syndesmoses and symphyses .",1
10275,"Diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint , as in synovial joints .",1
10276,"There are several different types of angular movements , including flexion , extension , hyperextension , abduction , adduction , and circumduction .",0
10277,"Flexion , or bending , occurs when the angle between the bones decreases .",1
10278,Moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist to move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion .,0
10279,Abduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body .,1
10280,Examples of abduction are moving the arms or legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side .,0
10281,Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its longitudinal axis .,1
10282,"Rotation can be toward the midline of the body , which is referred to as medial rotation , or away from the midline of the body , which is referred to as lateral rotation .",0
10283,"Inversion involves the soles of the feet moving inward , toward the midline of the body .",1
10284,"Eversion is the opposite of inversion , movement of the sole of the foot outward , away from the midline of the body .",1
10285,Protraction is the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane .,1
10286,Protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards .,0
10287,"Elevation is the movement of a bone upward , such as when the shoulders are shrugged , lifting the scapulae .",1
10288,"Depression is the opposite of elevation — movement downward of a bone , such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position .",1
10289,Dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee .,1
10290,"Plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted , such as when standing on the toes .",1
10291,Supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward .,1
10292,"Pronation is the opposite movement , in which the palm faces backward .",0
10293,"Opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand , making it possible to grasp and hold objects .",1
10294,Pivot joints consist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone .,1
10295,"This structure allows rotational movement , as the rounded bone moves around its own axis .",0
10296,"Ball - and - Socket JointsBall - and - socket joints possess a rounded , ball - like end of one bone fitting into a cuplike socket of another bone .",1
10297,"This organization allows the greatest range of motion , as all movement types are possible in all directions .",0
10298,"Smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines , stomach , and urinary bladder , and around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels .",0
10299,"Smooth muscle has no striations , is not under voluntary control , has only one nucleus per cell , is tapered at both ends , and is called involuntary muscle .",1
10300,"The sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction , which triggers muscle contraction .",1
10301,Within each muscle fiber are myofibrils — long cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber .,1
10302,"Myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber , and because they are only approximately 1.2 µm in diameter , hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber .",0
10303,There are two main types of filaments : thick filaments and thin filaments ; each has different compositions and locations .,0
10304,Thick filaments occur only in the A band of a myofibril .,0
10305,Thin filaments attach to a protein in the Z disc called alpha - actinin and occur across the entire length of the I band and partway into the A band .,0
10306,"Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules , preventing cross - bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input .",1
10307,Troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule ; it also binds calcium ions .,1
10308,"Bone , or osseous tissue , is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton .",1
10309,It contains specialized cells and a matrix of mineral salts and collagen fibers .,0
10310,Long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends .,1
10311,"The diaphysis , or central shaft , contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity .",1
10312,"The rounded ends , the epiphyses , are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow , which produces blood cells ( [ link ] ) .",1
10313,Flat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where broad surfaces of muscle attachment are required .,1
10314,"Examples of flat bones are the sternum ( breast bone ) , ribs , scapulae ( shoulder blades ) , and the roof of the skull ( [ link ] ) .",0
10315,"Sutural bones are small , flat , irregularly shaped bones .",1
10316,They may be found between the flat bones of the skull .,0
10317,They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone .,0
10318,"Each osteon consists of lamellae , which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal .",1
10319,The Haversian canal ( osteonic canal ) contains the bone ’s blood vessels and nerve fibers ( [ link ] ) .,1
10320,Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue .,0
10321,"Instead , it consists of trabeculae , which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates .",1
10322,Red bone marrow is found between the trabuculae .,0
10323,"Bone may also be resorbed for remodeling , if the applied stresses have changed .",0
10324,Osteocytes are mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue ; these cells can not divide .,1
10325,Osteocytes maintain normal bone structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix .,0
10326,Intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes .,1
10327,"It is involved in the formation of the flat bones of the skull , the mandible , and the clavicles .",0
10328,Appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of bones .,1
10329,"Osteoblasts at the bone surface secrete bone matrix , and osteoclasts on the inner surface break down bone .",1
10330,"From the nasal cavity , air passes through the pharynx ( throat ) and the larynx ( voice box ) , as it makes its way to the trachea ( [ link ] ) .",1
10331,The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body .,0
10332,"In the lungs , air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages , or bronchi .",0
10333,Air enters the lungs through the two primary ( main ) bronchi ( singular : bronchus ) .,0
10334,"Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi , then into tertiary bronchi , which in turn divide , creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung .",0
10335,They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape .,0
10336,"As the passageways decrease in diameter , the relative amount of smooth muscle increases . The terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles .",0
10337,The respiratory bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts .,0
10338,"The air that organisms breathe contains particulate matter such as dust , dirt , viral particles , and bacteria that can damage the lungs or trigger allergic immune responses .",0
10339,The respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid problems or tissue damage .,0
10340,"At maximal capacity , an average lung can hold almost six liters of air , but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity .",0
10341,Air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and lung capacities ( [ link ] and [ link ] ) .,0
10342,Volume measures the amount of air for one function ( such as inhalation or exhalation ) .,1
10343,It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal .,0
10344,"Conversely , the inspiratory reserve volume ( IRV ) is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation .",1
10345,The residual volume ( RV ) is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled .,1
10346,"It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume , tidal volume , and inspiratory reserve volume .",0
10347,The inspiratory capacity ( IC ) is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal expiration .,1
10348,"It is , therefore , the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume .",0
10349,Lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry .,0
10350,"An important measurement taken during spirometry is the forced expiratory volume ( FEV ) , which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period , usually one second ( FEV1 ) .",1
10351,"Gas Exchange across the AlveoliIn the body , oxygen is used by cells of the body ’s tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product .",0
10352,The ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient ( RQ ) .,1
10353,RQ varies between 0.7 and 1.0 .,0
10354,No muscles are contracting to expel the air . Each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac .,0
10355,The layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the visceral pleura .,1
10356,A second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax ( [ link ] ) .,0
10357,The number of breaths per minute is the respiratory rate .,1
10358,"On average , under non - exertion conditions , the human respiratory rate is 12–15 breaths / minute .",0
10359,This surface tension is similar to the surface tension of water at the liquid - air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together .,0
10360,Surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the alveoli tissue and the air found within the alveoli .,1
10361,"By lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid , it reduces the tendency of alveoli to collapse .",0
10362,Examples of restrictive diseases are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis .,0
10363,"In both diseases , the airways are less compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic .",0
10364,It is also independent of cardiac output .,0
10365,"This is because of a phenomenon called recruitment , which is the process of opening airways that normally remain closed when cardiac output increases .",1
10366,"As cardiac output increases , the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused ( filled with blood ) increases .",1
10367,Dead space is created when no ventilation and/or perfusion takes place .,1
10368,"Anatomical dead space or anatomical shunt , arises from an anatomical failure , while physiological dead space or physiological shunt , arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries .",1
10369,The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood ( x - axis ) versus the relative Hb - oxygen saturation ( y - axis ) .,1
10370,"The resulting graph — an oxygen dissociation curve — is sigmoidal , or S - shaped ( [ link ] ) .",0
10371,"As the partial pressure of oxygen increases , the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen .",0
10372,This is painful when it occurs .,0
10373,Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of Hb .,1
10374,"Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells , but these cells have lower - than - normal levels of hemoglobin .",0
10375,"In this system , carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells .",0
10376,Carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) within the red blood cells quickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic acid ( H2CO3 ) .,0
10377,Carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule that immediately dissociates into bicarbonate ions,1
10378,"As opposed to a closed system , arthropods — including insects , crustaceans , and most mollusks — have an open circulatory system , as illustrated in [ link]b .",0
10379,"In an open circulatory system , the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid .",1
10380,"As the heart beats and the animal moves , the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called ostia .",0
10381,The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re - oxygenated ; this is called gill circulation .,1
10382,The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium ; this is called systemic circulation .,1
10383,This unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish ’s systemic circuit .,0
10384,"As shown in [ link]b , amphibians have a three - chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two - chambered heart of fish .",0
10385,"The two atria ( superior heart chambers ) receive blood from the two different circuits ( the lungs and the systems ) , and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart ’s ventricle ( inferior heart chamber ) , which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation .",1
10386,The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body .,0
10387,"Blood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones , and by removing waste .",0
10388,Blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease - fighting agents or white blood cells to sites of infection .,0
10389,"The atria are the chambers that receive blood , and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood .",1
10390,"The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava , which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms , as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs .",1
10391,"In addition , the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself .",1
10392,The left atrium then receives the oxygen - rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins .,0
10393,"This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve ( the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart ) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through aorta , the major artery of the body , taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body .",1
10394,"Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta , the aortic semilunar valve ( or aortic valve ) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle .",0
10395,The myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall .,1
10396,"The outer layer of cells is called the epicardium , of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart ; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures .",1
10397,The heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood .,0
10398,Atherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques .,1
10399,"Because of the size ( narrow ) of the coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself , atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries .",0
10400,"The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day .",0
10401,"In each cardiac cycle , the heart contracts ( systole ) , pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body ; this is followed by a relaxation phase ( diastole ) , where the heart fills with blood , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
10402,"The atria contract at the same time , forcing blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles .",0
10403,The electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes .,0
10404,This information can be observed as an electrocardiogram ( ECG)—a recording of the electrical impulses of the cardiac muscle .,1
10405,Arterioles diverge into capillary beds .,0
10406,Capillary beds contain a large number ( 10 to 100 ) of capillaries that branch among the cells and tissues of the body .,0
10407,"Capillaries are narrow - diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients , waste , and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level .",1
10408,"In capillaries , this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells , as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis .",0
10409,"The movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by vasoconstriction , narrowing of the blood vessels , and vasodilation , widening of the blood vessels ; this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure .",1
10410,"Throughout the cardiac cycle , the blood continues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate .",1
10411,This resistance to blood flow is called peripheral resistance .,0
10412,Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane .,1
10413,"Osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance ( osmotic balance ) across membranes within the body ’s fluids , which are composed of water , plus electrolytes and non - electrolytes .",1
10414,An electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water .,1
10415,"The body ’s fluids include blood plasma , the cytosol within cells , and interstitial fluid , the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body .",1
10416,"The membranes of the body ( such as the pleural , serous , and cell membranes ) are semi - permeable membranes .",0
10417,Semi - permeable membranes are permeable ( or permissive ) to certain types of solutes and water .,1
10418,The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution .,1
10419,The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent .,1
10420,"If the solvent is water , one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water .",0
10421,"The kidneys , illustrated in [ link ] , are a pair of bean - shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver in the peritoneal cavity .",1
10422,The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands .,0
10423,The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia .,1
10424,"The second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule , which helps anchor the kidneys in place .",1
10425,The third and innermost layer is the renal capsule .,1
10426,The hilum is the concave part of the bean - shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney ; it is also the point of exit for the ureters .,1
10427,The renal cortex is granular due to the presence of nephrons — the functional unit of the kidney .,1
10428,"The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses , called the renal pyramids .",0
10429,"There are , on average , eight renal pyramids in each kidney .",0
10430,The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes of the kidney .,1
10431,The renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney .,0
10432,"On the inside of the kidney , the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces , which further branch into the minor calyces .",1
10433,The ureters are urine - bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder .,1
10434,The renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys .,0
10435,"Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes .",0
10436,The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries .,0
10437,"Each kidney is made up of over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex , giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally .",0
10438,"There are two types of nephrons — cortical nephrons ( 85 percent ) , which are deep in the renal cortex , and juxtamedullary nephrons ( 15 percent ) , which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla .",0
10439,"A nephron consists of three parts — a renal corpuscle , a renal tubule , and the associated capillary network , which originates from the cortical radiate arteries .",0
10440,The renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into three parts based on function .,1
10441,The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule ( PCT ) due to its proximity to the glomerulus ; it stays in the renal cortex .,0
10442,"The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla .",0
10443,The capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered .,0
10444,The branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole .,1
10445,The branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole .,1
10446,"In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT .",1
10447,"In juxtamedullary nephrons , the peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called the vasa recta .",0
10448,Water is also reabsorbed during this step .,0
10449,"Then , additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion , which is , in essence , the opposite process to tubular reabsorption .",0
10450,The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae .,0
10451,The osmotic gradient increases as it moves deeper into the medulla .,0
10452,"Because two sides of the loop of Henle perform opposing functions , as illustrated in [ link ] , it acts as a countercurrent multiplier .",0
10453,She also wrote a newspaper column and had a weekly radio show .,0
10454,"Her immediate successors returned to the less visible role held by her predecessors , although in the early 1960s , Jacqueline Kennedy gained attention for her efforts to refurbish the White House along historical lines , and Lady Bird Johnson in the mid- and late 1960s endorsed an effort to beautify public spaces and highways in the United States .",0
10455,"She also established the foundations of what came to be known as the Office of the First Lady , complete with a news reporter , Liz Carpenter , as her press secretary .",0
10456,She shared with the public the news of her breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent mastectomy .,0
10457,"Her successor , Rosalynn Carter , attended several cabinet meetings and pushed for the ratification of the ERA as well as for legislation addressing mental health issues ( [ link ] ) .",0
10458,"The public role of the first lady reach a new level with Hillary Clinton in the 1990s when her husband put her in charge of his efforts to achieve health care reform , a controversial decision that did not meet with political success .",0
10459,"Her successors , Laura Bush in the first decade of the twenty - first century and Michelle Obama in the second , returned to the roles played by predecessors in advocating less controversial policies : Laura Bush advocated literacy and education , while Michelle Obama has emphasized physical fitness and healthy diet and exercise .",0
10460,"Nevertheless , the public and political profiles of first ladies remain high , and in the future , the president ’s spouse will have the opportunity to use that unelected position to advance policies that might well be less controversial and more appealing than those pushed by the president .",0
10461,"The president may not be able to appoint key members of his or her administration without Senate confirmation , but he or she can demand the resignation or removal of cabinet officers , high - ranking appointees ( such as ambassadors ) , and members of the presidential staff .",0
10462,"During Reconstruction , Congress tried to curtail the president ’s removal power with the Tenure of Office Act ( 1867 ) , which required Senate concurrence to remove presidential nominees who took office upon Senate confirmation .",0
10463,Andrew Johnson ’s violation of that legislation provided the grounds for his impeachment in 1868 .,0
10464,"Many of the most famous executive orders have come in times of war or invoke the president ’s authority as commander - in - chief , including Franklin Roosevelt ’s order permitting the internment of Japanese Americans in 1942 and Harry Truman ’s directive desegregating the armed forces ( 1948 ) .",0
10465,"The most famous presidential proclamation was Abraham Lincoln ’s Emancipation Proclamation ( 1863 ) , which declared slaves in areas under Confederate control to be free ( with a few exceptions ) .",1
10466,"Finally , presidents have also used the line - item veto and signing statements to alter or influence the application of the laws they sign .",0
10467,A line - item veto is a type of veto that keeps the majority of a spending bill unaltered but nullifies certain lines of spending within it .,1
10468,"While a number of states allow their governors the line - item veto ( discussed in the chapter on state and local government ) , the president acquired this power only in 1996 after Congress passed a law permitting it .",0
10469,But the advent of civil service reform in the 1880s systematically deprived presidents of that option and reduced its scope and effectiveness .,0
10470,"Although the president may call upon various agencies for assistance in lobbying for proposals , such as the Office of Legislative Liaison with Congress , it is often left to the chief executive to offer incentives and rewards .",0
10471,"Some of these are symbolic , like private meetings in the White House or an appearance on the campaign trail .",0

10655,"Contraction phases in which there is no economic growth for two consecutive quarters , called recessions , would bring business failures and higher unemployment .",1
10656,"But this condition , they believed , would correct itself on its own if the government simply allowed the system to operate .",0
10657,"The desire of Keynesians to create a minimal level of aggregate demand , coupled with a Depression - era preference to promote social welfare policy , led the president and Congress to develop a federal budget with spending divided into two broad categories : mandatory and discretionary ( see [ link ] ) .",0

10694,"So , for the most part , the Supreme Court is an appeals court , operating under appellate jurisdiction and hearing appeals from the lower courts .",1
10695,The rest of the development of the judicial system and the creation of the lower courts were left in the hands of Congress .,0
10696,"In their first case of significance , Chisholm v. Georgia ( 1793 ) , the justices ruled that the federal courts could hear cases brought by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state , and that Article III , Section 2 , of the Constitution did not protect the states from facing such an interstate lawsuit .

Madison , 5 U.S. 137 ( 1803 ) . Wielding this power is a role Marshall defined as the “ very essence of judicial duty , ” and it continues today as one of the most significant aspects of judicial power .",1
10702,Judicial review lies at the core of the court ’s ability to check the other branches of government — and the states .,0
10703,"President Adams had appointed William Marbury to a position in Washington , DC , but his commission was not delivered before Adams left office .",0
10704,"So Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court to use its power under the Judiciary Act of 1789 and issue a writ of mandamus to force the new president ’s secretary of state , James Madison , to deliver the commission documents .",0
10705,It was a task Madison refused to do .,0
10706,The federal court system is most often called upon when a case touches on constitutional rights .,0
10707,"For example , when Samantha Elauf , a Muslim woman , was denied a job working for the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch because a headscarf she wears as religious practice violated the company ’s dress code , the Supreme Court ruled that her First Amendment rights had been violated , making it possible for her to sue the store for monetary damages .",0
10708,"In a number of cases , they have expressed reluctance to expand rights without limit , and they still balance that expansion with the government ’s need to govern , provide for the common good , and serve a broader societal purpose .",0
10709,"For example , the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty , ruling that the Eighth Amendment does not prevent a person from being put to death for committing a capital crime and that the government may consider “ retribution and the possibility of deterrence ” when it seeks capital punishment for a crime that so warrants it . Gregg v. Georgia , 428 U.S. 153 ( 1976 ) .",1
10710,"In other words , there is a greater good — more safety and security — that may be more important than sparing the life of an individual who has committed a heinous crime .",0

10713,Crimes are usually labeled felonies or misdemeanors based on their nature and seriousness ; felonies are the more serious crimes .,1
10714,"The federal courts , on the other hand , will hear any case that involves a foreign government , patent or copyright infringement , Native American rights , maritime law , bankruptcy , or a controversy between two or more states .",1
10715,"Cases arising from activities across state lines ( interstate commerce ) are also subject to federal court jurisdiction , as are cases in which the United States is a party .",0
10716,"There are ninety - four U.S. district courts in the fifty states and U.S. territories , of which eighty - nine are in the states ( at least one in each state ) .",0
10717,"The others are in Washington , DC ; Puerto Rico ; Guam ; the U.S. Virgin Islands ; and the Northern Mariana Islands .",0
10718,Today ’s federal court system was not an overnight creation ; it has been changing and transitioning for more than two hundred years through various acts of Congress .,0
10719,"Since district courts are not called for in Article III of the Constitution , Congress established them and narrowly defined their jurisdiction , at first limiting them to handling only cases that arose within the district .",1
10720,"Beginning in 1789 when there were just thirteen , the district courts became the basic organizational units of the federal judicial system .",0
10721,"The U.S. court system operates on the principle of stare decisis ( Latin for stand by things decided ) , which means that today ’s decisions are based largely on rulings from the past , and tomorrow ’s rulings rely on what is decided today .",1
10722,"Stare decisis is especially important in the U.S. common law system , in which the consistency of precedent ensures greater certainty and stability in law and constitutional interpretation , and it also contributes to the solidity and legitimacy of the court system itself .",0

10737,"With the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 , there remain three current justices who are considered part of the Court ’s more conservative wing — Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justices Thomas and Alito , while four are considered more liberal - leaning — Justices Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Kagan ( [ link ] ) .",0
10738,"Justice Kennedy has become known as the “ swing ” vote , particularly on decisions like the Court ’s same - sex marriage rulings in 2015 , because he sometimes takes a more liberal position and sometimes a more conservative one .",0

10761,"In addition to these expressed powers , the national government was given implied powers that , while not clearly stated , are inferred .",0
10762,"These powers stem from the elastic clause in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution , which provides Congress the authority “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the Foregoing powers . ” This statement has been used to support the federal government ’s playing a role in controversial policy matters , such as the provision of healthcare , the expansion of power to levy and collect taxes , and regulation of interstate commerce .",1

10826,"Forests , water , and fisheries , however , are a type of public good called common goods , which are not excludable but may be finite .",1
10827,"The problem with both public and common goods is that since no one owns them , no one has a financial interest in protecting their long - term or future value .",0
10828,"Without government regulation , a factory owner can feel free to pollute the air or water , since he or she will have no responsibility for the pollution once the winds or waves carry it somewhere else ( see [ link ] ) .",0
10829,"In 1964 , Theodore Lowi argued that it was possible to categorize policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or diffused across the many .",0
10830,"One policy category , known as distributive policy , tends to collect payments or resources from many but concentrates direct benefits on relatively few .",1
10831,"While distributive policy , according to Lowi , has diffuse costs and concentrated benefits , regulatory policy features the opposite arrangement , with concentrated costs and diffuse benefits .",1
10832,"A relatively small number of groups or individuals bear the costs of regulatory policy , but its benefits are expected to be distributed broadly across society .",0
10833,"A final type of policy is redistributive policy , so named because it redistributes resources in society from one group to another .",1
10834,"That is , according to Lowi , the costs are concentrated and so are the benefits , but different groups bear the costs and enjoy the benefits .",0
10835,"After completing a minimum number of years of work , American workers may claim a form of pension upon reaching retirement age .",0
10836,"It is often called an entitlement program since it guarantees benefits to a particular group , and virtually everyone will eventually qualify for the plan given the relatively low requirements for enrollment .",1
10837,The amount of money a worker receives is based loosely on his or her lifetime earnings .,0
10838,"Medicaid is a formula - based , health insurance program , which means beneficiaries must demonstrate they fall within a particular income category .",1
10839,"Individuals in the Medicaid program receive a fairly comprehensive set of health benefits , although access to health care may be limited because fewer providers accept payments from the program ( it pays them less for services than does Medicare ) .",0
10840,A lobbying group that frequently takes on advocacy roles is AARP ( formerly the American Association of Retired Persons ) ( [ link ] ) .,0
10841,"AARP ’s primary job is to convince the government to provide more public resources and services to senior citizens , often through regulatory or redistributive politics .",1
10842,"The policy process contains four sequential stages : ( 1 ) agenda setting , ( 2 ) policy enactment , ( 3 ) policy implementation , and ( 4 ) evaluation .",1
10843,"Given the sheer number of issues already processed by the government , called the continuing agenda , and the large number of new proposals being pushed at any one time , it is typically quite difficult to move a new policy all the way through the process . Agenda setting is the crucial first stage of the public policy process .",0
10844,6987 .,0
10845,Roosevelt sought to implement a new approach to economic regulation known as Keynesianism .,0
10846,"Named for its developer , the economist John Maynard Keynes , Keynesian economics argues that it is possible for a recession to become so deep , and last for so long , that the typical models of economic collapse and recovery may not work .",1
10847,Keynes suggested that economic growth was closely tied to the ability of individuals to consume goods .,0
10848,Portions of the budget not devoted to mandatory spending are categorized as discretionary spending because Congress must pass legislation to authorize money to be spent each year .,0
10849,"About 50 percent of the approximately $ 1.2 trillion set aside for discretionary spending each year pays for most of the operations of government , including employee salaries and the maintenance of federal buildings .",0
10850,"As you would expect , Keynesians and supply - siders disagree about which forms of tax policy are best .",0
10851,"Keynesians , with their concern about whether consumers can really stimulate demand , prefer progressive taxes systems that increase the effective tax rate as the taxpayer ’s income increases .",0
10852,This policy leaves those most likely to spend their money with more money to spend .,0
10853,"Financial panics arise when too many people , worried about the solvency of their investments , try to withdraw their money at the same time .",0
10854,"Such panics plagued U.S. banks until 1913 ( [ link ] ) , when Congress enacted the Federal Reserve Act .",0
10855,"The act established the Federal Reserve System , also known as the Fed , as the central bank of the United States .",1
10856,"If the European continent was stable , so too was the world .",0
10857,"During the Cold War era that followed World War II , stability was achieved by the existence of dual superpowers , the United States and the Soviet Union , and by the real fear of the nuclear annihilation of which both were capable .",0
10858,"Until approximately 1989–1990 , advanced industrial democracies aligned themselves behind one of these two superpowers .",0
10859,One of the unique and challenging aspects of global affairs is the fact that no world - level authority exists to mandate when and how the world ’s nations interact .,0
10860,"After the failed attempt by President Woodrow Wilson and others to formalize a “ League of Nations ” in the wake of World War I in the 1920s , and on the heels of a worldwide depression that began in 1929 , came World War II , history ’s deadliest military conflict .",0
10861,"Now , in the early decades of the twenty - first century , it is common to think of the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 as the big game - changer .",0
10862,The balance of trade is the relationship between a country ’s inflow and outflow of goods .,1
10863,"The United States sells many goods and services around the world , but overall it maintains a trade deficit , in which more goods and services are coming in from other countries than are going out to be sold overseas .",1
10864,"At the more serious end of the foreign policy decision - making spectrum , and usually as a last resort when diplomacy fails , the U.S. military and defense establishment exists to provide the United States the ability to wage war against other state and nonstate actors .",0
10865,"Such war can be offensive , as were the Iraq War in 2003 and the 1989 removal of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega .",0
10866,"Or it can be defensive , as a means to respond to aggression from others , such as the Persian Gulf War in 1991 , also known as Operation Desert Storm ( [ link ] ) .",0
10867,This makes diplomacy and international coordination an ongoing bargain as issues evolve and governmental leaders and nations change .,0
10868,"Foreign relations are certainly made smoother by the existence of cross - national voluntary associations like the United Nations , the Organization of American States , and the African Union .",0
10869,"netophytesGnetophytes are the closest relative to modern angiosperms , and include three dissimilar genera of plants : Ephedra , Gnetum , and Welwitschia ( [ link ] ) .",0
10870,"Like angiosperms , they have broad leaves .",0
10871,"lowers pollinated by wind are usually small , feathery , and visually inconspicuous .",0
10872,Sepals and petals together form the perianth .,1
10873,The sexual organs ( carpels and stamens ) are located at the center of the flower .,1
10874,tamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac - like structure called the anther .,1
10875,"The filament supports the anther , where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains .",1
10876,"oevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support , especially because both angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle Mesozoic .",0
10877,"Many authors have attributed the diversity of plants and insects to pollination and herbivory , or consumption of plants by insects and other animals .",0
10878,This is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination .,0
10879,"n seed plants , the evolutionary trend led to a dominant sporophyte generation , and at the same time , a systematic reduction in the size of the gametophyte : from a conspicuous structure to a microscopic cluster of cells enclosed in the tissues of the sporophyte .",0
10880,"Whereas lower vascular plants , such as club mosses and ferns , are mostly homosporous ( produce only one type of spore ) , all seed plants , or spermatophytes , are heterosporous .",1
10881,They form two types of spores : megaspores ( female ) and microspores ( male ) .,1
10882,"he process of animal development begins with the cleavage , or series of mitotic cell divisions , of the zygote ( [ link ] ) .",1
10883,Three cell divisions transform the single - celled zygote into an eight - celled structure .,0
10884,"ore complex animals ( those with bilateral symmetry ) develop three tissue layers : an inner layer ( endoderm ) , an outer layer ( ectoderm ) , and a middle layer ( mesoderm ) .",1
10885,Animals with three tissue layers are called triploblasts .,1
10886,"rotostomes include arthropods , mollusks , and annelids .",0
10887,Deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms .,0
10888,These two groups are separated based on which opening of the digestive cavity develops first : mouth or anus .,0
10889,he bilaterally symmetrical animals are further divided into deuterostomes ( including chordates and echinoderms ) and two distinct clades of protostomes ( including ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans ) ( [ link]ab ) .,0
10890,Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : exoskeletal molting ( termed ecdysis ) .,1
10891,"Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features , each common to certain phyla within the clade .",0
10892,"hile the validity of this claim is still under investigation , these primitive fossils appear to be small , one - centimeter long , sponge - like creatures .",0
10893,"These fossils from South Australia date back 650 million years , actually placing the putative animal before the great ice age extinction event that marked the transition between the Cryogenian period and the Ediacaran period .",0
10894,"Until this discovery , most scientists believed that there was no animal life prior to the Ediacaran period .",0
10895,ater can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall .,0
10896,Water entering the spongocoel is extruded via a large common opening called the osculum .,1
10897,"However , sponges exhibit a range of diversity in body forms , including variations in the size of the spongocoel , the number of osculi , and where the cells that filter food from the water are located .",0
10898,he gel - like consistency of mesohyl acts like an endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges .,0
10899,"In addition to the osculum , sponges have multiple pores called ostia on their bodies that allow water to enter the sponge .",1
10900,"In some sponges , ostia are formed by porocytes , single tube - shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel .",1
10901,"n some sponges , sclerocytes secrete small spicules into the mesohyl , which are composed of either calcium carbonate or silica , depending on the type of sponge .",0
10902,These spicules serve to provide additional stiffness to the body of the sponge .,0
10903,nidarians contain specialized cells known as cnidocytes ( “ stinging cells ” ) containing organelles called nematocysts ( stingers ) .,0
10904,"These cells are present around the mouth and tentacles , and serve to immobilize prey with toxins contained within the cells .",1
10905,"he outer layer ( from ectoderm ) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal , whereas the inner layer ( from endoderm ) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity .",1
10906,"Between these two membrane layers is a non - living , jelly - like mesoglea connective layer .",0
10907,"In terms of cellular complexity , cnidarians show the presence of differentiated cell types in each tissue layer , such as nerve cells , contractile epithelial cells , enzyme - secreting cells , and nutrient - absorbing cells , as well as the presence of intercellular connections .",0
10908,he mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes .,0
10909,The slit - like mouth opening and pharynx are lined by a groove called a siphonophore .,1
10910,"The pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food , and may extend for up to two - thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity .",1
10911,"he rotifers are a microscopic ( about 100 µm to 30 mm ) group of mostly aquatic organisms that get their name from the corona , a rotating , wheel - like structure that is covered with cilia at their anterior end ( [ link ] ) .",1
10912,"Although their taxonomy is currently in flux , one treatment places the rotifers in three classes : Bdelloidea , Monogononta , and Seisonidea .",0
10913, unique characteristic of this phylum is the presence of a proboscis enclosed in a rhynchocoel .,0
10914,The proboscis serves to capture food and may be ornamented with barbs in some species .,1
10915,hylum Mollusca is the predominant phylum in marine environments .,0
10916,"It is estimated that 23 percent of all known marine species are mollusks ; there are over 75,000 described species , making them the second most diverse phylum of animals .",0
10917,"Most mollusks are dioecious animals and fertilization occurs externally , although this is not the case in terrestrial mollusks , such as snails and slugs , or in cephalopods .",0
10918,"In some mollusks , the zygote hatches and undergoes two larval stages — trochophore and veliger — before becoming a young adult ; bivalves may exhibit a third larval stage , glochidia .",0
10919,These animals are asymmetrical and usually present a coiled shell ( [ link ] ) .,0
10920,"Shells may be planospiral ( like a garden hose wound up ) , commonly seen in garden snails , or conispiral , ( like a spiral staircase ) , commonly seen in marine conches .",0
10921,"The phylum includes earthworms , polychaete worms , and leeches .",0
10922,"Annelids show protostomic development in embryonic stages and are often called “ segmented worms ” due to their key characteristic of metamerism , or true segmentation .",1
10923,"The number and size of chaetae are greatly diminished in Oligochaeta compared to the polychaetes ( poly = many , chaetae = hairs ) .",0
10924,"The many chetae of polychaetes are also arranged within fleshy , flat , paired appendages that protrude from each segment called parapodia , which may be specialized for different functions in the polychates .",1
10925,The subclass Hirudinea includes leeches such as Hirudo medicinalis and Hemiclepsis marginata .,0
10926,"Tagma may be in the form of a head , thorax , and abdomen , or a cephalothorax and abdomen , or a head and trunk .",0
10927,"A central cavity , called the hemocoel ( or blood cavity ) , is present , and the open circulatory system is regulated by a tubular or single - chambered heart .",0
10928,"Respiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod : insects and myriapods use a series of tubes ( tracheae ) that branch through the body , open to the outside through openings called spiracles , and perform gas exchange directly between the cells and air in the tracheae , whereas aquatic crustaceans utilize gills , terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs , and aquatic chelicerates use book gills ( [ link ] ) .",1
10929,"Most crustaceans are dioecious , which means that the sexes are separate .",1
10930,Some species like barnacles may be hermaphrodites .,0
10931,"Serial hermaphroditism , where the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova , may also be seen in some species .",1
10932,A “ head ” tagmum is not usually discernible .,0
10933,"The phylum derives its name from the first pair of appendages : the chelicerae ( [ link ] ) , which are specialized , claw - like or fang - like mouthparts .",1
10934,These animals do not possess antennae .,0
10935,"There are a series of other developmental characteristics that differ between protostomes and deuterostomes , including the mode of formation of the coelom and the early cell division of the embryo .",0
10936,"In deuterostomes , internal pockets of the endodermal lining called the archenteron fuse to form the coelom .",1
10937,The endodermal lining of the archenteron ( or the primitive gut ) forms membrane protrusions that bud off and become the mesodermal layer .,0
10938,These tube feet help in attachment to the substratum .,0
10939,These animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system .,0
10940,"An interesting feature of these animals is their power to regenerate , even when over 75 percent of their body mass is lost .",0
10941,"Characteristics of ChordataAnimals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage during their development : a notochord , a dorsal hollow nerve cord , pharyngeal slits , and a post - anal tail ( [ link ] ) .",0
10942,"In some groups , some of these are present only during embryonic development .",0
10943,Pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx ( the region just posterior to the mouth ) that extend to the outside environment .,1
10944,"In organisms that live in aquatic environments , pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding .",0
10945,Members of Urochordata are also known as tunicates ( [ link ] ) .,1
10946,"The name tunicate derives from the cellulose - like carbohydrate material , called the tunic , which covers the outer body of tunicates .",0
10947,"A cranium is a bony , cartilaginous , or fibrous structure surrounding the brain , jaw , and facial bones ( [ link ] ) .",1
10948,"Most bilaterally symmetrical animals have a head ; of these , those that have a cranium compose the clade Craniata .",0
10949,"Vertebrates display the four characteristic features of the chordates ; however , members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates .",0
10950,"Vertebrata is named for the vertebral column , composed of vertebrae , a series of separate bones joined together as a backbone ( [ link ] ) .",1
10951,"In adult vertebrates , the vertebral column replaces the notochord , which is only seen in the embryonic stage .",0
10952,The clade Myxini includes at least 20 species of hagfishes .,0
10953,"Hagfishes are eel - like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates , other fishes , and marine mammals ( [ link ] ) .",1
10954,"Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world , except for the polar regions .",0
10955,Gnathostomes or “ jaw - mouths ” are vertebrates that possess jaws .,1
10956,"One of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw , which is a hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food .",1
10957,Electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals .,0
10958,"Sharks , together with most fishes and aquatic and larval amphibians , also have a sense organ called the lateral line , which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water , and is often considered homologous to “ hearing ” in terrestrial vertebrates .",1
10959,The lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fish ’s body .,0
10960,"Many bony fishes also have a swim bladder , a gas - filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish .",1
10961,Bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades : Actinopterygii ( ray - finned fishes ) and Sarcopterygii ( lobe - finned fishes ) .,1
10962,"Evolution of tetrapods from fishes represented a significant change in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water , to organisms that breathed air and moved onto land ; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the Devonian period .",0
10963,One of the earliest known tetrapods is from the genus Acanthostega .,0
10964,Acanthostega was aquatic ; fossils show that it had gills similar to fishes .,0
10965,Frogs are amphibians that belong to the order Anura ( [ link ] ) .,0
10966,"Anurans are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates , with approximately 5,965 species that occur on all of the continents except Antarctica .",0
10967,Extra - embryonic membranes are membranes present in amniotic eggs that are not a part of the body of the developing embryo .,1
10968,"While the inner amniotic membrane surrounds the embryo itself , the chorion surrounds the embryo and yolk sac .",1
10969,The chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg ’s external environment .,0
10970,The initial split was into synapsids and sauropsids .,0
10971,"Synapsids include all mammals , including extinct mammalian species .",0
10972,"Synapsids also include therapsids , which were mammal - like reptiles from which mammals evolved .",0
10973,Temporal fenestrae are post - orbital openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen .,1
10974,"Anapsids have no temporal fenestrae , synapsids have one , and diapsids have two .",1
10975,"Anapsids include extinct organisms and may , based on anatomy , include turtles .",0
10976,"In cold weather , some reptiles such as the garter snake brumate .",0
10977,"Brumation is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long periods without eating , but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves .",1
10978,"Rather , their metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures , and the animal is very sluggish .",0
10979,"Crocodilia ( “ small lizard ” ) arose with a distinct lineage by the middle Triassic ; extant species include alligators , crocodiles , and caimans .",0
10980,"Crocodilians ( [ link ] ) live throughout the tropics and subtropics of Africa , South America , Southern Florida , Asia , and Australia .",0
10981,Turtles are members of the clade Testudines ( “ having a shell ” ) ( [ link ] ) .,0
10982,Turtles are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell .,0
10983,Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body .,0
10984,"Eccrine glands produce sweat , or perspiration , which is mainly composed of water .",1
10985,"In most mammals , eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body , and some mammals do not possess them at all .",0
10986,The skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features .,0
10987,"The lower jaw of mammals consists of only one bone , the dentary .",0
10988,The jaws of other vertebrates are composed of more than one bone .,0
10989,"There are three living species of monotremes : the platypus and two species of echidnas , or spiny anteaters .",0
10990,"The leathery - beaked platypus belongs to the family Ornithorhynchidae ( “ bird beak ” ) , whereas echidnas belong to the family Tachyglossidae ( “ sticky tongue ” ) ( [ link ] ) .",0
10991,"Some examples are Insectivora , the insect eaters ; Edentata , the toothless anteaters ; Rodentia , the rodents ; Cetacea , the aquatic mammals including whales ; Carnivora , carnivorous mammals including dogs , cats , and bears ; and Primates , which includes humans .",0
10992,"Eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals because all species possess a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother , allowing for gas , fluid , and nutrient exchange .",1
10993,"While other mammals possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta , all eutherians possess a complex placenta during gestation .",0
10994,"Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings , primary feathers and secondary feathers .",0
10995,Primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust .,1
10996,"Secondary feathers are located closer to the body , attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift .",1
10997,"The sternum of birds is larger than that of other vertebrates , which accommodates the large muscles required to generate enough upward force to generate lift with the flapping of the wings .",0
10998,"Another skeletal modification found in most birds is the fusion of the two clavicles ( collarbones ) , forming the furcula or wishbone .",1
10999,The furcula is flexible enough to bend and provide support to the shoulder girdle during flapping .,0
11000,"The second group , bipedal predators called theropods , includes birds .",0
11001,"This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds , specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones , as well as the presence of the wishbone , formed by the fusing of the clavicles . One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx , which is from the Jurassic period ( [ link ] ) .",1
11002,"Archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs , because it is an intermediate fossil , meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds .",0
11003,"Order Primates of class Mammalia includes lemurs , tarsiers , monkeys , apes , and humans .",0
11004,"Non - human primates live primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions of South America , Africa , and Asia .",0
11005,Order Primates is divided into two groups : prosimians and anthropoids .,0
11006,"Prosimians include the bush babies of Africa , the lemurs of Madagascar , and the lorises , pottos , and tarsiers of Southeast Asia .",0
11007,"Anthropoids include monkeys , apes , and humans .",0
11008,"By 40 million years ago , evidence indicates that monkeys were present in the New World ( South America ) and the Old World ( Africa and Asia ) .",1
11009,New World monkeys are also called Platyrrhini — a reference to their broad noses ( [ link ] ) .,0
11010,Old World monkeys are called Catarrhini — a reference to their narrow noses .,0
11011,"The lesser apes comprise the family Hylobatidae , including gibbons and siamangs .",0
11012,"The great apes include the genera Pan ( chimpanzees and bonobos ) ( [ link]a ) , Gorilla ( gorillas ) , Pongo ( orangutans ) , and Homo ( humans ) ( [ link]b ) .",1
11013,"The very arboreal gibbons are smaller than the great apes ; they have low sexual dimorphism ( that is , the sexes are not markedly different in size ) ; and they have relatively longer arms used for swinging through trees . The ( a ) chimpanzee is one of the great apes .",1
11014,Australopithecus ( “ southern ape ” ) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately 4 million years ago and went extinct about 2 million years ago .,1
11015,"This genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus , genus Homo , evolved from a common ancestor shared with Australopithecus about 2 million years ago ( after likely passing through some transitional states ) .",0
11016,"Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems : a shoot system , and a root system .",0
11017,"The shoot system consists of two portions : the vegetative ( non - reproductive ) parts of the plant , such as the leaves and the stems , and the reproductive parts of the plant , which include flowers and fruits .",1
11018,"The shoot system generally grows above ground , where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis .",0
11019,"Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems , which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth .",1
11020,"Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated , and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant .",1
11021,"In contrast , permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing .",1
11022,"Apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots , which enable a plant to extend in length .",1
11023,Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .,1
11024,"Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots , at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes ( the areas where leaves attach to a stem ) .",1
11025,"Dermal tissue covers and protects the plant , and vascular tissue transports water , minerals , and sugars to different parts of the plant .",1
11026,"Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis , provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue , and helps to store water and sugars .",1
11027,"Nodes are points of attachment for leaves , aerial roots , and flowers .",1
11028,The stem region between two nodes is called an internode .,1
11029,The stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole .,1
11030,Parenchyma cells are the most common plant cells ( [ link ] ) .,0
11031,"They are found in the stem , the root , the inside of the leaf , and the pulp of the fruit .",0
11032,"The dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis , a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue .",1
11033,"Woody plants have a tough , waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark , which further protects the plant from damage .",1
11034,"Two cells , known as guard cells , surround each leaf stoma , controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor .",1
11035,Trichomes are hair - like structures on the epidermal surface .,1
11036,"They help to reduce transpiration ( the loss of water by aboveground plant parts ) , increase solar reflectance , and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores .

11054,"In contrast , a fibrous root system is located closer to the soil surface , and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion ( lawn grasses are a good example , as are wheat , rice , and corn ) .",1
11055,Some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots .,0
11056,"The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root , which is called the stele ( [ link ] ) .",1
11057,A layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root .,1

11280,Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant .,1
11281,"Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots , at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes ( the areas where leaves attach to a stem ) .",1
11282,"This tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the leaf base ; for example , it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing .",1
11283,The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other ( [ link ] ) .,0

11303,The periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants .,0
11304,"In some plants , the periderm has many openings , known as lenticels , which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere ( [ link ] ) .",1

11342,"Growth of the shoot apical tip upward is called negative gravitropism , whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism .",1
11343,Apical dominance — the inhibition of lateral bud formation — is triggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem .,1
11344,"Flowering , fruit setting and ripening , and inhibition of abscission ( leaf falling ) are other plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins .",1
11345,Auxins also act as a relay for the effects of the blue light and red / far - red responses .,0
11346,The plant hormone abscisic acid ( ABA ) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls .,1

11386,Supporting this is the fact that very distant galaxies are more likely to have abnormally energetic cores .,0
11387,"Some of the moderately distant galaxies , and hence among the younger , are known as quasars and emit as much or more energy than a normal galaxy but from a region less than a light year across .",1
11388,"Quasar energy outputs may vary in times less than a year , so that the energy - emitting region must be less than a light year across .",0
11389,The motion of stars in galaxies and the motion of galaxies in clusters imply that there is about 10 times as much mass as in the luminous objects we can see .,0
11390,The indirectly observed non - luminous matter is called dark matter .,1
11391,Why is dark matter a problem ?,0
11392,This means that you can in principle travel an unlimited distance in any direction .,0
11393,A universe that is closed is called positively curved .,1
11394,"This means that if you travel far enough in any direction , you will return to your starting point , analogous to circumnavigating the Earth .",0
11395,Searches for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in galactic halos because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there .,0
11396,"Such microlensing objects are thus called massive compact halo objects , or MACHOs .",0
11397,"To date , a few MACHOs have been observed , but not predominantly in galactic halos , nor in the numbers needed to explain dark matter .",0
11398,"These are called weakly interacting massive particles , or WIMPs , and would also be chargeless , thus interacting negligibly with normal matter , except through gravitation .",0

11404,"This superposition forms a disturbance called a sonic boom , a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound .",1

11420,"The U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line , who are referred to as the near - poor . Such programs are called the safety net , in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income .",1
11421,"SNAP participation increased by 70 % between 2007 and 2011 , from 26.6 million participants to 45 million .",0
11422,"According to the Congressional Budget Office , this dramatic rise in participation was caused by the Great Recession of 2008–2009 and rising food prices . The federal government deploys a range of income security programs that are funded through departments such as Health and Human Services , Agriculture , and Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) ( see [ link ] ) .",0
11423,"According to the Office of Management and Budget , collectively , these three departments provided an estimated $ 62 billion of aid through programs such as supplemental feeding programs for women and children , subsidized housing , and energy assistance .",0
11424,Economists have focused their explanations for the increasing inequality on two factors that changed more or less continually from the 1970s into the 2000s .,0
11425,"One set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of American households ; the other focuses on greater inequality of wages , what some economists call “ winner take all ” labor markets .",0
11426,"We will begin with how we measure inequality , and then consider the explanations for growing inequality in the United States . Measuring Income Distribution by QuintilesOne common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income , from lowest to highest , and then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people , known as quintiles .",1
11427,"The programs are paid for through the federal income tax , which is a progressive tax system designed in such a way that the rich pay a higher percent in income taxes than the poor .",1
11428,"Data from household income tax returns in 2009 shows that the top 1 % of households had an average income of $ 1,219,700 per year in pre - tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of 28.9 % .",0
11429,"The United States does have an estate tax — that is , a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance — which suggests a willingness to limit how much wealth can be passed on as an inheritance .",1
11430,"However , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , in 2015 the estate tax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than $ 5.43 million and thus applies to only a tiny percentage of those with high levels of wealth .",0
11431,What are the limits on how much higher pay they can receive ?,0
11432,"To analyze these questions , let ’s consider a situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with a single union , and no firm is allowed to hire nonunion labor .",0
11433,"If no labor union existed in this market , then equilibrium ( E ) in the labor market would occur at the intersection of the demand for labor ( D ) and the supply of labor ( S ) in [ link ] .",0
11434,"In the past , presidential use of the Taft - Hartley Act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but , in this case , it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement . In other instances , unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies .",0
11435,"In one prominent example , during the 1950s and 1960s , the United Mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install labor - saving machinery in the mines .",0
11436,"The mineworkers’ union realized that over time , the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the mines , but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive , and mechanization was a necessary step toward greater productivity .",0
11437,"Discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain group are inferior solely because of a factor such as race , gender , or religion .",1
11438,"There are many types of discrimination but the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets , which arises if workers with the same skill levels — as measured by education , experience , and expertise — receive different pay receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their race or gender .",0
11439,"If some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or minorities a wage based on their productivity , then other profit - seeking employers can hire these workers .",0
11440,"In a competitive market , if the owners of a business care more about the color of money than about the color of skin , they will have an incentive to make buying , selling , hiring , and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors .",0
11441,Supporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns .,0

11444,"The general rule is that all treatments to gemstones should be revealed , but often disclosure is not made .",0
11445,"As such , many buyers face a situation of asymmetric information , where the both parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal amount of information ( one party knows much more than the other ) .",1
11446,For a market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full information about the product ’s price and quality .,0
11447,"If there is limited information , then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make poor decisions .",0
11448,"When buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the quality of products , then markets may have trouble reaching an equilibrium price and quantity .",0
11449,"Imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of used cars that do not seem to be selling , and so the dealer decides to cut the prices of the cars to sell a greater quantity .",0
11450,"In the goods market , the seller of a good might offer a money - back guarantee , an agreement that functions as a promise of quality .",1
11451,"This strategy may be especially important for a company that sells goods through mail - order catalogs or over the web , whose customers can not see the actual products , because it encourages people to buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it .",0
11452,"Sellers of labor provide information through resumes , recommendations , school transcripts , and examples of their work .",0
11453,Occupational licenses are also used to establish quality in the labor market .,0
11454,"Occupational licenses , which are typically issued by government agencies , show that a worker has completed a certain type of education or passed a certain test .",1
11455,"In the financial capital market , before a bank makes a loan , it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income ; in addition , the bank conducts a credit check on the individual ’s past borrowing .",0
11456,"Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan ; that is , another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so .",1
11457,"Yet another approach is to require collateral , often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid .",1
11458,"Pension insurance : Employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a small fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation , which is used to pay at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and can not pay the pensions it has promised .",1
11459,"Retirement insurance : All workers pay a percentage of their income into Social Security and into Medicare , which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly .",1
11460,Social Security and Medicare are not literally “ insurance ” in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits .,0
11461,Another method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs .,0
11462,"For example , insurance policies often have deductibles , which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of their own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying .",1
11463,"For example , auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $ 500 .",0
11464,"A final way of reducing moral hazard , which is especially applicable to health care , is to focus on the incentives of providers of health care , rather than consumers .",0
11465,"Traditionally , most health care in the United States has been provided on a fee - for - service basis , which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they provide and are paid more if they provide additional services .",1
11466,"However , in the last decade or so , the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) .",0
11467,The Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) will be funded through additional taxes to include :,0
11468,Firms often make decisions that involve spending money in the present and expecting to earn profits in the future .,0
11469,"Examples include when a firm buys a machine that will last 10 years , or builds a new plant that will last for 30 years , or starts a research and development project .",0
11470,Firms can raise the financial capital they need to pay for such projects in four main ways : ( 1 ) from early - stage investors ; ( 2 ) by reinvesting profits ; ( 3 ) by borrowing through banks or bonds ; and ( 4 ) by selling stock .,0
11471,"In this way , an individual investor could , in effect , loan the firm $ 5,000 , or any multiple of that amount .",0
11472,Anyone who owns a bond and receives the interest payments is called a bondholder .,1
11473,"If a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments , the bondholders can take the firm to court and require it to pay , even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or equipment .",0
11474,"Those who buy the stock become the owners , or shareholders , of the firm .",0
11475,"Stock represents ownership of a firm ; that is , a person who owns 100 % of a company ’s stock , by definition , owns the entire company .",1
11476,The stock of a company is divided into shares .,0
11477,That rate of return can come in two forms .,0
11478,"A firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders , called a dividend .",1
11479,"Alternatively , a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal - Mart for $ 45 and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $ 60 , for a gain of $ 15 .",0
11480,A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day - to - day basis .,0
11481,"A private company can be run by individuals , in which case it is called a sole proprietorship , or it can be run by a group , in which case it is a partnership .",1
11482,"A private company can also be a corporation , but with no publicly issued stock .",0
11483,A high - risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months or years and much lower in other months or years .,0
11484,"The actual rate of return refers to the total rate of return , including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a period of time .",1
11485,"A checking account typically pays little or no interest , but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money , either by writing a check or by using a debit card ( that is , a card which works like a credit card , except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company ) .",1
11486,"A savings account typically pays some interest rate , but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine ( or you can access the funds electronically ) .",1
11487,"The lines between checking and savings accounts have blurred in the last couple of decades , as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an interest rate similar to a savings account if you keep a certain minimum amount in the account , or conversely , offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least a few checks per month .",0
11488,"Firms that appear to be riskier borrowers , perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear shaky , will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds .",0
11489,Bonds that offer high interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance of default are called high yield bonds or junk bonds .,1
11490,"A number of today ’s well - known firms issued junk bonds in the 1980s when they were starting to grow , including Turner Broadcasting and Microsoft .",0
11491,( Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest . ),0
11492,The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment .,1
11493,"Combining the bond ’s face value , interest rate , and maturity date , and market interest rates , allows a buyer to compute a bond ’s present value , which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond .",0
11494,"[ link ] shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds : 10-year Treasury bonds ( which are officially called “ notes ” ) and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an AAA rating as relatively safe borrowers by Moody ’s , an independent firm that publishes such ratings .",0
11495,"Even though corporate bonds pay a higher interest rate , because firms are riskier borrowers than the federal government , the rates tend to rise and fall together .",0
11496,"Purchasing a diversified group of the stocks or bonds has gotten easier in the Internet age , but it remains something of a task .",0
11497,"To simplify the process , companies offer mutual funds , which are organizations that buy a range of stocks or bonds from different companies .",1
11498,"The financial investor buys shares of the mutual fund , and then receives a return based on how the fund as a whole performs .",0
11499,The chief problem with attempting to buy stock in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that many other financial investors are trying to do the same thing .,0
11500,"Thus , in attempting to get rich in the stock market , it is no help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have already reached the same conclusion , because the stock price will already be high , based on the expected high level of future profits . The idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and unexpected implication .",0
11501,"For example , many U.S. drivers do not much care where the tires for their car were made — they just want good quality as inexpensively as they can get it .",0
11502,"In September 2009 , President Obama and Congress enacted a tariff ( taxes added on imported goods ) on tires imported from China that would increase the import price of Chinese tires by 35 percent in its first year , 30 percent in its second year , and 25 percent in its third year .",1
11503,"Interestingly , the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor this step , because most of them also import tires from China and other countries .",0
11504,"As this example suggests , we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution — the problem called regulatory capture ( which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust Policy ) .",0
11505,"In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes , or rules for safety in the workplace , or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations , you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma .",0
11506,They talk with the legislators who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative wording .,0
11507,"Politicians have an incentive to ensure that government money is spent in their home state or district , where it will benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way .",0
11508,"Thus , when legislators are negotiating over whether to support a piece of legislation , they commonly ask each other to include pork - barrel spending , legislation that benefits mainly a single political district .",1
11509,"Pork - barrel spending is another case in which democracy is challenged by concentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs : the benefits of pork - barrel spending are obvious and direct to local voters , while the costs are spread over the entire country .",0
11510,Does the majority view prevail in the case of sugar quotas ?,0
11511,"Clearly there are more sugar consumers in the United States than sugar producers , but the U.S. domestic sugar lobby ( www.sugarcane.org ) has successfully argued for protection against imports since 1789 .",0
11512,"When a firm produces a product no one wants to buy or produces at a higher cost than its competitors , the firm is likely to suffer losses .",0
11513,"If it can not change its ways , it will go out of business .",0
11514,"As you learn in the micro part of this book , principal tools used by economists are theories and models ( see Welcome to Economics !",0
11515,for more on this ) .,0
11516,"In microeconomics , we used the theories of supply and demand ; in macroeconomics , we use the theories of aggregate demand ( AD ) and aggregate supply ( AS ) .",0
11517,"This book presents two perspectives on macroeconomics : the Neoclassical perspective and the Keynesian perspective , each of which has its own version of AD and AS .",0
11518,"Investment expenditure refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment , primarily by businesses .",1
11519,"If Starbucks builds a new store , or Amazon buys robots , these expenditures are counted under business investment .",0
11520,Everything that is purchased must be produced first .,0
11521,"[ link ] breaks down what is produced into five categories : durable goods , nondurable goods , services , structures , and the change in inventories .",0
11522,"Before going into detail about these categories , notice that total GDP measured according to what is produced is exactly the same as the GDP measured by looking at the five components of demand .",0
11523,"Net national product ( NNP ) is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out , or reduced in value because of aging , over the course of a year .",1
11524,The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation .,1
11525,"The NNP can be further subdivided into national income , which includes all income to businesses and individuals , and personal income , which includes only income to people .",1
11526,The nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time .,1
11527,The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation .,1
11528,"Generally , it is the real value that is more important .",0
11529,"Because 2005 is the base year , the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year .",0
11530,"However , over time , the rise in nominal GDP looks much larger than the rise in real GDP ( that is , the nominal GDP line rises more steeply than the real GDP line ) , because the rise in nominal GDP is exaggerated by the presence of inflation , especially in the 1970s . U.S .",0
11531,"Nominal and Real GDP , 1960–2012 The red line measures U.S. GDP in nominal dollars .",0
11532,An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression .,1
11533,"The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure , as is the Great Recession of 2008–2009 .",0
11534,"A private think tank , the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) , is the official tracker of business cycles for the U.S. economy .",0
11535,"However , the effects of a severe recession often linger on after the official ending date assigned by the NBER.Key Concepts and Summary",0
11536,"So is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than most other countries , or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per - person basis ?",0
11537,"This question can be answered by calculating a country ’s GDP per capita ; that is , the GDP divided by the population .",1
11538,GDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society .,0
11539,GDP per capita is only an average .,0
11540,"When GDP per capita rises by 5 % , it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5 % , or that of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less — or even declined .",0
11541,"According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden , slavery - based societies , favorable demographics , global trading routes , and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed .",0
11542,The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power - driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s .,1
11543,"Ingenious machines — the steam engine , the power loom , and the steam locomotive — performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do .",0
11544,"In other words , how efficient is your nation with its time and workers ?",0
11545,Labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input .,1
11546,The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread .,0
11547,"To analyze the sources of economic growth , it is useful to think about a production function , which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor , machinery , and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers .",1
11548,"A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm , or perhaps an industry .",0
11549,It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time .,0
11550,"Similarly , compound rates of economic growth , or the compound growth rate , means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth , with dramatic effects over time .",1
11551,"It may not make sense to compare the GDPs of China and say , Benin , simply because of the great difference in population size .",0
11552,"To understand economic growth , which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person , it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita .",0
11553,"Using GDP per capita also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people , like Belgium , Uruguay , or Zimbabwe , with countries that have larger populations , like the United States , the Russian Federation , or Nigeria .",0
11554,Special Economic Zones .,0
11555,The island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage international trade in government - supported special economic zones ( SEZ ) .,0
11556,"These are areas of the country , usually with access to a port where , among other benefits , the government does not tax trade .",1
11557,A first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns .,0
11558,"Even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase GDP per capita , the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital , the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish .",1
11559,"For example , raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth - grade level to a high school diploma ( while holding all other inputs constant ) would produce a certain increase in output .",0
11560,An economy with high unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused factory .,0
11561,The opportunity cost of unemployment is the output that could have been produced by the unemployed workers .,0
11562,"They are , however , also counted in the employed group .",0
11563,"All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term “ hidden unemployment . ” Discouraged workers , those who have stopped looking for employment and , hence , are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group",1
11564,The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy .,0
11565,"During periods of recession and depression , unemployment is high .",0
11566,"During periods of economic growth , unemployment tends to be lower .",0
11567,The variation in unemployment caused by the economy moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion ( i.e .,1
11568,the business cycle ) is known as cyclical unemployment .,0
11569,"One set of reasons why wages may be “ sticky downward , ” as economists put it , involves economic laws and institutions .",0
11570,"For low - skilled workers being paid the minimum wage , it is illegal to reduce their wages .",0
11571,"For union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company , wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike .",0
11572,"Efficiency wage theory argues that the productivity of workers depends on their pay , and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate .",1
11573,"One reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs , they would suffer a decline in salary .",0
11574,"The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ” A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on .",1
11575,"However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects . Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan .",1
11576,"Instead , workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut , and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others .",0
11577,"But in the real world , even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies , it takes time to find out about new jobs , to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match , or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job .",0
11578,"The unemployment that occurs in the meantime , as workers move between jobs , is called frictional unemployment .",1
11579,Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing .,0
11580,Inflation is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy .,1
11581,Inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices .,0
11582,"To calculate the price level , economists begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services , consisting of the different items individuals , businesses , or organizations typically buy .",0
11583,The next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time .,0
11584,Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time .,1
11585,"To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number , economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year , or starting point from which we measure changes in prices .",0
11586,"The base year , by definition , has an index number equal to 100 .",0
11587,"A fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods , regardless of price changes — not a very likely assumption .",0
11588,"Thus , substitution bias — the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time — tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen .",1
11589,The BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods .,0
11590,"For example , the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services .",1
11591,"It can be broken down into price indices for different industries , commodities , and stages of processing ( like finished goods , intermediate goods , crude materials for further processing , and so on ) .",0
11592,An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market .,0
11593,"The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) .",1
11594,"Unlike the CPI , its baskets are not fixed but re - calculate what that year ’s GDP would have been worth using the base - year ’s prices .",0
11595,"Inflation in China averaged about 10 % per year for much of the 1980s and early 1990s , although it has dropped off since then .",0
11596,"Russia experienced hyperinflation — an outburst of high inflation — of 2,500 % per year in the early 1990s , although by 2006 Russia ’s consumer price inflation had dipped below 10 % per year , as shown in [ link ] .",1
11597,"The closest the United States has ever gotten to hyperinflation was during the Civil War , 1860–1865 , in the Confederate states . Countries with Relatively High Inflation Rates , 1980–2013These charts show the percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year ’s consumer prices in Brazil , China , and Russia .",0
11598,"Economists note that over most periods , the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages , and so they reason that , on average , over time , people ’s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation .",0
11599,"If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change .",0
11600,"Moreover , the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful , prolonged conflicts between employers and employees .",0
11601,"If the minimum wage is adjusted for inflation only infrequently , minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages , as shown in [ link].U.S .",0
11602,"Minimum Wage and Inflation After adjusting for inflation , the federal minimum wage dropped more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010 , even though the nominal figure climbed from $ 1.40 to $ 7.25 per hour .",0
11603,"Prices are the messengers in a market economy , conveying information about conditions of demand and supply .",0
11604,Inflation blurs those price messages .,0
11605,"Second , an argument is sometimes made that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible .",0
11606,The discussion in Unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result .,0
11607,"In the 1970s and 1980s , labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had cost - of - living adjustments ( COLAs ) which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation .",1
11608,"These contracts were sometimes written as , for example , COLA plus 3 % .",0
11609,"Also , Social Security is funded by payroll taxes , which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount—$117,000 in 2014 .",0
11610,"This level of income is adjusted upward each year according to the rate of inflation , so that the indexed rise in the benefit level is accompanied by an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base . As yet another example of a government program affected by indexing , in 1996 the U.S. , government began offering indexed bonds .",0
11611,"Bonds are means by which the U.S. government ( and many private - sector companies as well ) borrows money ; that is , investors buy the bonds , and then the government repays the money with interest .",1
11612,"Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus .",0
11613,"If imports exceed exports , the economy is said to have a trade deficit .",1
11614,"If exports and imports are equal , then trade is balanced .",0
11615,Old habits are hard to break .,0
11616,"Economists , however , typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid .",0
11617,The second row of [ link ] provides data on trade in services .,0
11618,"Here , the U.S. economy is running a surplus .",0
11619,"Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades .",0
11620,"Some of the other countries listed include Brazil , the largest economy in Latin America ; Nigeria , the largest economy in Africa ; and China , India , and Korea .",0
11621,The first column offers one measure of the globalization of an economy : exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP .,0
11622,The second column shows the trade balance .,0
11623,The connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that the balance of trade is sometimes described as the balance of payments .,0
11624,Each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy .,0
11625,The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance .,0
11626,"In a nation ’s financial capital market , the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments .",0
11627,What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital ?,0
11628,"For most years of the nineteenth century , U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit .",0
11629,"Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all ; instead , the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by around 1900 .",0
11630,The balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade .,0
11631,"The United States has a low level of trade , but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s .",0
11632,Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767–1832 ) .,0
11633,"Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view . The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production .",1
11634,"To be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses .",0
11635,"Nevertheless , a recession is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes .",0
11636,"Generally , you pick up on depth in these images even though the visual stimulus is 2-D .",0
11637,"When we do this , we are relying on a number of monocular cues , or cues that require only one eye .",1
11638,"If you think you ca n’t see depth with one eye , note that you do n’t bump into things when using only one eye while walking — and , in fact , we have more monocular cues than binocular cues .",0
11639,"The outer ear includes the pinna , which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads , the auditory canal , and the tympanic membrane , or eardrum . The middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles , which are named the malleus ( or hammer ) , incus ( or anvil ) , and the stapes ( or stirrup ) .",1
11640,"The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea .",1
11641,"As the stapes presses into the oval window , the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move , which in turn stimulates hair cells , which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane .",0
11642,The basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea .,1
11643,The ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing .,0
11644,Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields .,0
11645,Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head .,1
11646,Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear ( [ link ] ) .,1
11647,"Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where along a horizontal axis a sound originates ( Grothe et al . , 2010 ) .",0
11648,One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease .,0
11649,"Although not well understood , Ménière 's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , tinnitus ( constant ringing or buzzing ) , vertigo ( a sense of spinning ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( Semaan & Megerian , 2011 ) .",1
11650,"This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option .",0
11651,Taste ( gustation ) and smell ( olfaction ) are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe .,0
11652,There is a pronounced interaction between our chemical senses .,0
11653,"Many species respond to chemical messages , known as pheromones , sent by another individual ( Wysocki & Preti , 2004 ) .",1
11654,Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status of a potential mate .,0
11655,Some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain .,1
11656,This very rare genetic disorder is known as congenital insensitivity to pain ( or congenital analgesia ) .,0
11657,"While those with congenital analgesia can detect differences in temperature and pressure , they can not experience pain .",0
11658,"Wertheimer , and his assistants Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka , who later became his partners , believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli .",1
11659,This belief led to a new movement within the field of psychology known as Gestalt psychology .,0
11660,"The word gestalt literally means form or pattern , but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts .",0
11661,We might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields .,0
11662,"According to this principle , things that are alike tend to be grouped together ( [ link ] ) .",0
11663,"According to Gestalt theorists , pattern perception , or our ability to discriminate among different figures and shapes , occurs by following the principles described above .",0
11664,"You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case .",0
11665,"Built from sensations , but influenced by our own experiences , biases , prejudices , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person .",0
11666,Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception .,0
11667,"For instance , several studies have demonstrated that non - Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non - weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person ( Payne , 2001 ; Payne , Shimizu , & Jacoby , 2005 ) .",0
11668,"Learning , like reflexes and instincts , allows an organism to adapt to its environment .",0
11669,"But unlike instincts and reflexes , learned behaviors involve change and experience : learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience .",1
11670,"In contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above , learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through experience .",0
11671,"Pavlov ( 1849–1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) .",0
11672,"As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events . Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning .",0
11673,The meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism .,1
11674,The dogs’ salivation was an unconditioned response ( UCR ) : a natural ( unlearned ) reaction to a given stimulus .,1
11675,"Before conditioning , think of the dogs’ stimulus and response like this :",0
11676,"Eventually , the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone , just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants’ footsteps .",0
11677,The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned response ( CR ) .,1
11678,"In the case of Pavlov ’s dogs , they had learned to associate the tone ( CS ) with being fed , and they began to salivate ( CR ) in anticipation of food .",0
11679,Taste aversion is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the conditioned stimulus ( something ingested ) and the unconditioned stimulus ( nausea or illness ) .,1
11680,Here ’s how it works .,0
11681,"Animals ( including humans ) need to distinguish between stimuli — for example , between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not — so that they can respond appropriately ( such as running away if the sound is threatening ) .",0
11682,"When an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar , it is called stimulus discrimination .",1
11683,"In classical conditioning terms , the organism demonstrates the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus .",0
11684,"John B. Watson , shown in [ link ] , is considered the founder of behaviorism .",0
11685,"Behaviorism is a school of thought that arose during the first part of the 20th century , which incorporates elements of Pavlov ’s classical conditioning ( Hunt , 2007 ) .",1
11686,Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior : the reinforcements and punishments .,0
11687,"His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike .",0
11688,"According to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated ( Thorndike , 1911 ) .",1
11689,"In negative reinforcement , an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior .",1
11690,"For example , car manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems , which go “ beep , beep , beep ” until you fasten your seatbelt .",0
11691,"In this case , a stimulus ( the reprimand ) is added in order to decrease the behavior ( texting in class ) .",0
11692,"In negative punishment , you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior .",1
11693,"For example , when a child misbehaves , a parent can take away a favorite toy .",0
11694,A secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primary reinforcer .,1
11695,"Praise , linked to affection , is one example of a secondary reinforcer , as when you called out “ Great shot ! ” every time Joaquin made a goal .",0
11696,Now let ’s combine these four terms .,0
11697,A fixed interval reinforcement schedule is when behavior is rewarded after a set amount of time .,1
11698,"For example , June undergoes major surgery in a hospital .",0
11699,"In a variable ratio reinforcement schedule , the number of responses needed for a reward varies .",1
11700,This is the most powerful partial reinforcement schedule .,0
11701,"As soon as the rats became aware of the food , they were able to find their way through the maze quickly , just as quickly as the comparison group , which had been rewarded with food all along .",0
11702,This is known as latent learning : learning that occurs but is not observable in behavior until there is a reason to demonstrate it . Psychologist Edward Tolman found that rats use cognitive maps to navigate through a maze .,1
11703,Have you ever worked your way through various levels on a video game ?,0
11704,"Imitation is much more obvious in humans , but is imitation really the sincerest form of flattery ?",0
11705,Consider Claire ’s experience with observational learning .,0
11706,"On the other hand , if you observed the model being punished , you would be less motivated to copy her .",1
11707,This is called vicarious punishment .,0
11708,"For example , imagine that four - year - old Allison watched her older sister Kaitlyn playing in their mother ’s makeup , and then saw Kaitlyn get a time out when their mother came in .",0
11709,Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think .,1
11710,"It attempts to explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking , emotion , creativity , language , and problem solving , in addition to other cognitive processes .",0
11711,"In psychology , concepts can be divided into two categories , natural and artificial .",0
11712,Natural concepts are created “ naturally ” through your experiences and can be developed from either direct or indirect experiences .,1
11713,"For example , if you live in Essex Junction , Vermont , you have probably had a lot of direct experience with snow .",0
11714,There are several types of schemata .,0
11715,"A role schema makes assumptions about how individuals in certain roles will behave ( Callero , 1994 ) .",1
11716,"For example , imagine you meet someone who introduces himself as a firefighter .",0
11717,"Language , be it spoken , signed , or written , has specific components : a lexicon and grammar .",0
11718,Lexicon refers to the words of a given language .,1
11719,"Thus , lexicon is a language ’s vocabulary .",0
11720,"A phoneme ( e.g. , the sounds “ ah ” vs. “ eh ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different languages have different sets of phonemes .",1
11721,"Phonemes are combined to form morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ I ” is both a phoneme and a morpheme ) .",1
11722,We use semantics and syntax to construct language .,0
11723,"However , young children master language very quickly with relative ease .",0
11724,B. F. Skinner ( 1957 ) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement .,0
11725,"Noam Chomsky ( 1965 ) criticized this behaviorist approach , asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined .",0
11726,A problem - solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution .,0
11727,Different strategies have different action plans associated with them ( [ link ] ) .,0
11728,A heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy .,0
11729,"While an algorithm must be followed exactly to produce a correct result , a heuristic is a general problem - solving framework ( Tversky & Kahneman , 1974 ) .",1
11730,You can think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems .,0
11731,Functional fixedness is a type of mental set where you can not perceive an object being used for something other than what it was designed for .,1
11732,"During the Apollo 13 mission to the moon , NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft .",0
11733,"For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis .",0
11734,"Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t .",1
11735,"In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did .",0
11736,"Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors .",1
11737,"James theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts , which aid survival ( [ link ] ) .",0
11738,"From a biological perspective , an instinct is a species - specific pattern of behavior that is not learned .",1
11739,"There was , however , considerable controversy among James and his contemporaries over the exact definition of instinct .",0
11740,Researchers Robert Yerkes ( pronounced “ Yerk - EES ” ) and John Dodson discovered that the optimal arousal level depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed ( [ link ] ) .,0
11741,"This relationship is known as Yerkes - Dodson law , which holds that a simple task is performed best when arousal levels are relatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower .",1
11742,"Maslow ’s Hierarchy of NeedsWhile the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives , individual characteristics , or social contexts , Abraham Maslow ( 1943 ) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motives ranging from the biological to the individual to the social .",0
11743,These needs are often depicted as a pyramid ( [ link ] ) .,0
11744,Creative intelligence is marked by inventing or imagining a solution to a problem or situation .,1
11745,Creativity in this realm can include finding a novel solution to an unexpected problem or producing a beautiful work of art or a well - developed short story .,0
11746,"Divergent thinking can be described as thinking “ outside the box ; ” it allows an individual to arrive at unique , multiple solutions to a given problem .",1
11747,"In contrast , convergent thinking describes the ability to provide a correct or well - established answer or solution to a problem ( Cropley , 2006 ; Gilford , 1967 )",1
11748,The various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the brain .,0
11749,"Research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important sites where this integration occurs ( Ahima & Antwi , 2008 ; Woods & D’Alessio , 2008 ) .",0
11750,"OBESITYWhen someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height , they are considered overweight or obese .",0
11751,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , an adult with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight ( [ link ] ) .",0
11752,"An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] , 2012 ) .",1
11753,"In cases in which a person has had no success with repeated attempts to reduce weight or is at risk for death because of obesity , bariatric surgery may be recommended .",0
11754,"Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery specifically aimed at weight reduction , and it involves modifying the gastrointestinal system to reduce the amount of food that can be eaten and/or limiting how much of the digested food can be absorbed ( [ link ] ) ( Mayo Clinic , 2013 ) .",1
11755,"A recent meta - analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is more effective than non - surgical treatment for obesity in the two - years immediately following the procedure , but to date , no long - term studies yet exist ( Gloy et al . , 2013 ) .",0
11756,"As of the 2013 release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , fifth edition , Binge eating disorder is a disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .",0
11757,"Unlike with bulimia , eating binges are not followed by inappropriate behavior , such as purging , but they are followed by distress , including feelings of guilt and embarrassment .",0
11758,"Physicians were considered authorities on all issues related to sex , despite the fact that they had little to no training in these issues , and it is likely that most of what people knew about sex had been learned either through their own experiences or by talking with their peers .",0
11759,"Convinced that people would benefit from a more open dialogue on issues related to human sexuality , Dr. Alfred Kinsey of Indiana University initiated large - scale survey research on the topic ( [ link ] ) .",0
11760,"The results of some of these efforts were published in two books — Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female — which were published in 1948 and 1953 , respectively ( Bullough , 1998 ) .",0
11761,"Based on these observations , Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women : excitement , plateau , orgasm , and resolution ( [ link ] ) .",1
11762,"The excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle , and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal .",1
11763,Both men and women experience increases in muscle tone during this time .,0
11764,Orgasm is marked in women by rhythmic contractions of the pelvis and uterus along with increased muscle tension .,0
11765,"In men , pelvic contractions are accompanied by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles , ( i.e. , ejaculation ) .",0
11766,"In reality , these are two related , but different , issues .",0
11767,Gender identity refers to one ’s sense of being male or female .,1
11768,"Generally , our gender identities correspond to our chromosomal and phenotypic sex , but this is not always the case .",0
11769,"While you ’re likely familiar with the term “ IQ ” and associate it with the idea of intelligence , what does IQ really mean ?",0
11770,IQ stands for intelligence quotient and describes a score earned on a test designed to measure intelligence .,1
11771,"You ’ve already learned that there are many ways psychologists describe intelligence ( or more aptly , intelligences ) .",0
11772,"Interestingly , the periodic recalibrations have led to an interesting observation known as the Flynn effect .",0
11773,"Named after James Flynn , who was among the first to describe this trend , the Flynn effect refers to the observation that each generation has a significantly higher IQ than the last .",1
11774,"Flynn himself argues , however , that increased IQ scores do not necessarily mean that younger generations are more intelligent per se ( Flynn , Shaughnessy , & Fulgham , 2012 ) .",0
11775,Some researchers believe that intelligence is a trait inherited from a person ’s parents .,0
11776,Scientists who research this topic typically use twin studies to determine the heritability of intelligence .,0
11777,The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart is one of the most well - known twin studies .,0
11778,Children with dysgraphia have a learning disability that results in a struggle to write legibly .,1
11779,The physical task of writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person .,0
11780,Emotions are often thought to be consciously experienced and intentional .,0
11781,"Mood , on the other hand , refers to a prolonged , less intense , affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience .",1
11782,"Mood states may not be consciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion ( Beedie , Terry , Lane , & Devonport , 2011 ) .",0
11783,"Other theorists , however , doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience .",0
11784,"Thus , the Cannon - Bard theory of emotion was developed .",0
11785,"According to this view , physiological arousal and emotional experience occur simultaneously , yet independently ( Lang , 1994 ) .",1
11786,"The relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them , and the order in which these occur , remains a topic of research and debate .",0
11787,Lazarus ( 1991 ) developed the cognitive - mediational theory that asserts our emotions are determined by our appraisal of the stimulus .,1
11788,"This appraisal mediates between the stimulus and the emotional response , and it is immediate and often unconscious .",0
11789,"The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei , including the basolateral complex and the central nucleus ( [ link ] ) .",0
11790,The basolateral complex has dense connections with a variety of sensory areas of the brain .,1
11791,It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to learning processes and memory .,0
11792,Culture can impact the way in which people display emotion .,0
11793,"A cultural display rule is one of a collection of culturally specific standards that govern the types and frequencies of displays of emotions that are acceptable ( Malatesta & Haviland , 1982 ) .",1
11794,"Therefore , people from varying cultural backgrounds can have very different cultural display rules of emotion .",0
11795,"We also use the tone of our voices , various behaviors , and body language to communicate information about our emotional states .",0
11796,Body language is the expression of emotion in terms of body position or movement .,1
11797,"Research suggests that we are quite sensitive to the emotional information communicated through body language , even if we ’re not consciously aware of it ( de Gelder , 2006 ; Tamietto et al . , 2009 ) .",0
11798,"In the centuries after Galen , other researchers contributed to the development of his four primary temperament types , most prominently Immanuel Kant ( in the 18th century ) and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt ( in the 19th century ) ( Eysenck , 2009 ; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991 ; Wundt , 1874/1886 ) ( [ link ] ) .",0
11799,"Kant agreed with Galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there was no overlap between the four categories ( Eysenck , 2009 ) .",0
11800,"LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESSTo explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience , Freud compared the mind to an iceberg ( [ link ] ) .",0
11801,"He said that only about one - tenth of our mind is conscious , and the rest of our mind is unconscious .",0
11802,"Our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable to access ( Freud , 1923 ) .",1
11803,"It strives for perfection and judges our behavior , leading to feelings of pride or — when we fall short of the ideal — feelings of guilt .",0
11804,"In contrast to the instinctual i d and the rule - based superego , the ego is the rational part of our personality .",1
11805,"It ’s what Freud considered to be the self , and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others .",0
11806,Eventually you forget about it .,0
11807,"Similarly , in the human psyche , if a memory is too overwhelming to deal with , it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness ( Freud , 1920 ) .",0
11808,This repressed memory might cause symptoms in other areas .,0
11809,"For example , a four - year - old child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle .",0
11810,"In projection , a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else .",1
11811,"Other defense mechanisms include rationalization , displacement , and sublimation .",0
11812,"In the oral stage ( birth to 1 year ) , pleasure is focused on the mouth .",1
11813,"Eating and the pleasure derived from sucking ( nipples , pacifiers , and thumbs ) play a large part in a baby ’s first year of life .",0
11814,Following the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period ( 6 years to puberty ) .,1
11815,"This period is not considered a stage , because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other pursuits , such as school , friendships , hobbies , and sports .",0
11816,"Alfred Adler , a colleague of Freud ’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society ( Freud ’s inner circle of colleagues ) , was the first major theorist to break away from Freud ( [ link ] ) .",0
11817,"He subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority .",1
11818,"Adler ( 1937 , 1956 ) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex .",0
11819,"Carl Jung ( [ link ] ) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud , who later split off from Freud and developed his own theory , which he called analytical psychology .",0
11820,"The focus of analytical psychology is on working to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought , and experience within one ’s personality .",1
11821,Karen Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst .,0
11822,"During the Great Depression , Horney moved from Germany to the United States , and subsequently moved away from Freud ’s teachings .",0
11823,"If someone asks you what you ate for lunch today , more than likely you could recall this information quite easily .",0
11824,"This is known as automatic processing , or the encoding of details like time , space , frequency , and the meaning of words .",1
11825,Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness .,0
11826,"Visual encoding is the encoding of images , and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds , words in particular .",1
11827,"To see how visual encoding works , read over this list of words : car , level , dog , truth , book , value .",0
11828,Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information .,1
11829,"In order for a memory to go into storage ( i.e. , long - term memory ) , it has to pass through three distinct stages : Sensory Memory , Short - Term Memory , and finally Long - Term Memory .",0
11830,These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin ( 1968 ) .,0
11831,One study of sensory memory researched the significance of valuable information on short - term memory storage .,0
11832,"J. R. Stroop discovered a memory phenomenon in the 1930s : you will name a color more easily if it appears printed in that color , which is called the Stroop effect .",1
11833,"In other words , the word “ red ” will be named more quickly , regardless of the color the word appears in , than any word that is colored red .",0
11834,Long - term memory ( LTM ) is the continuous storage of information .,1
11835,"Unlike short - term memory , the storage capacity of LTM has no limits .",0
11836,Procedural memory is a type of implicit memory : it stores information about how to do things .,1
11837,"It is the memory for skilled actions , such as how to brush your teeth , how to drive a car , how to swim the crawl ( freestyle ) stroke .",0
11838,Episodic memory is information about events we have personally experienced .,1
11839,"The concept of episodic memory was first proposed about 40 years ago ( Tulving , 1972 ) .",0
11840,How do you get that information back out of storage when you need it ?,0
11841,The act of getting information out of memory storage and back into conscious awareness is known as retrieval .,1
11842,This would be similar to finding and opening a paper you had previously saved on your computer ’s hard drive .,0
11843,"The third form of retrieval is relearning , and it ’s just what it sounds like .",0
11844,It involves learning information that you previously learned .,1
11845,"First , let ’s look at the role of the amygdala in memory formation .",0
11846,"The main job of the amygdala is to regulate emotions , such as fear and aggression ( [ link ] ) .",0
11847,"There also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory , such as epinephrine , dopamine , serotonin , glutamate , and acetylcholine ( Myhrer , 2003 ) .",0
11848,"There continues to be discussion and debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role ( Blockland , 1996 ) .",0
11849,"Although we do n’t yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory , we do know that communication among neurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories .",0
11850,"In other words , people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning .",0
11851,"B. F. Skinner , a strict behaviorist , believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior , including the enduring , consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists .",0
11852,"In contrast to Skinner ’s idea that the environment alone determines behavior , Bandura ( 1990 ) proposed the concept of reciprocal determinism , in which cognitive processes , behavior , and context all interact , each factor influencing and being influenced by the others simultaneously ( [ link ] ) .",1
11853,"Cognitive processes refer to all characteristics previously learned , including beliefs , expectations , and personality characteristics .",1
11854,"Julian Rotter ( 1966 ) proposed the concept of locus of control , another cognitive factor that affects learning and personality development .",0
11855,"Distinct from self - efficacy , which involves our belief in our own abilities , locus of control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives .",1
11856,"In Rotter ’s view , people possess either an internal or an external locus of control ( [ link ] ) .",0
11857,"Anterograde amnesia is commonly caused by brain trauma , such as a blow to the head .",0
11858,"With anterograde amnesia , you can not remember new information , although you can remember information and events that happened prior to your injury .",1
11859,"The hippocampus is usually affected ( McLeod , 2011 ) .",0
11860,"Because memory is so fragile , witnesses can be easily ( and often accidentally ) misled due to the problem of suggestibility .",0
11861,Suggestibility describes the effects of misinformation from external sources that leads to the creation of false memories .,1
11862,"In the fall of 2002 , a sniper in the DC area shot people at a gas station , leaving Home Depot , and walking down the street .",0
11863,She has studied false memories as well as recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse .,0
11864,"Loftus also developed the misinformation effect paradigm , which holds that after exposure to incorrect information , a person may misremember the original event .",1
11865,"Let ’s look at the first sin of the forgetting errors : transience , which means that memories can fade over time .",1
11866,Here ’s an example of how this happens .,0
11867,"Now let ’s take a look at the three errors of distortion : misattribution , suggestibility , and bias .",0
11868,Misattribution happens when you confuse the source of your information .,1
11869,Let ’s say Alejandro was dating Lucia and they saw the first Hobbit movie together .,0
11870,"When the new year starts , do you find you accidentally write the previous year ?",0
11871,These are examples of proactive interference : when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information .,1
11872,Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information .,1
11873,This perspective focuses on how healthy people develop .,0
11874,"One pioneering humanist , Abraham Maslow , studied people who he considered to be healthy , creative , and productive , including Albert Einstein , Eleanor Roosevelt , Thomas Jefferson , Abraham Lincoln , and others .",0
11875,"Maslow ( 1950 , 1970 ) found that such people share similar characteristics , such as being open , creative , loving , spontaneous , compassionate , concerned for others , and accepting of themselves .",0
11876,Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves .,0
11877,"We experience congruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar — in other words , when our self - concept is accurate .",1
11878,t is biology ?,0
11879,"In simple terms , biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments .",1
11880,This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast .,0
11881," steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later , but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments .",0
11882,"A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event , which can be tested .",1
11883,"Although using the scientific method is inherent to science , it is inadequate in determining what science is .",0
11884," some experts , the natural sciences are astronomy , biology , chemistry , earth science , and physics .",0
11885,"Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences , which study living things and include biology , and physical sciences , which study nonliving matter and include astronomy , geology , physics , and chemistry .",1
11886,Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary .,0
11887,h types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study : descriptive science and hypothesis - based science .,0
11888,"Descriptive ( or discovery ) science , which is usually inductive , aims to observe , explore , and discover , while hypothesis - based science , which is usually deductive , begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested . The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred , and most scientific endeavors combine both approaches .",1

11898,All living things are made of cells ; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms .,1
11899,( This requirement is why viruses are not considered living : they are not made of cells .,0

12112,"The movement also created a political party — the Greenback Party , so named for its support of print currency ( or “ greenbacks ” ) not based upon a gold standard — which saw brief success with the election of fifteen congressmen . However , such successes were short - lived and had little impact on the lives of everyday farmers .",1
12113,"The causes of the Depression of 1893 were manifold , but one major element was the speculation in railroads over the previous decades .",0

12120,"During his time as governor , from 1901 through 1906 , La Follette introduced the Wisconsin Idea , wherein he hired experts to research and advise him in drafting legislation to improve conditions in his state .",1
12121,"“ Fighting Bob ” supported numerous Progressive ideas while governor : He signed into law the first workman ’s compensation system , approved a minimum wage law , developed a progressive tax law , adopted the direct election of U.S. senators before the subsequent constitutional amendment made it mandatory , and advocated for women ’s suffrage .",0
12122,"La Follette subsequently served as a popular U.S. senator from Wisconsin from 1906 through 1925 , and ran for president on the Progressive Party ticket in 1924.An energetic speaker and tireless Progressive , Governor Robert “ Fighting Bob ” La Follette turned the state of Wisconsin into a flagship for democratic reform .",0

12128,"By 1905 , he had grown wary of Booker T. Washington ’s calls for African Americans to accommodate white racism and focus solely on self - improvement .",0
12129,The new president ’s background suggested he would be a strong administrator .,0
12130,"He had previously served as the governor of the Philippines following the Spanish - American War , had a distinguished judicial career , and served as Roosevelt ’s Secretary of War from 1904 to 1908 .",0
12131,"Republican leaders , however , were anxious to reestablish tighter control over the party after Roosevelt ’s departure , and they left Taft little room to maneuver .",0
12132,"Wilson described his more moderate approach as one of New Freedom , which stood for a smaller federal government to protect public interests from the evils associated with big businesses and banks .",0
12133,"Roosevelt campaigned on the promise of New Nationalism , a charge that he said required a vigorous and powerful federal government to protect public interests .",1

12139,"Most famously , Theodore Roosevelt led his Rough Riders , an all - volunteer cavalry unit made up of adventure - seeking college graduates , and veterans and cowboys from the Southwest , in a charge up Kettle Hill , next to San Juan Hill , which resulted in American forces surrounding Santiago .",1
12140,"The victories of the Rough Riders are the best known part of the battles , but in fact , several African American regiments , made up of veteran soldiers , were instrumental to their success .",0
12141,"In 1899 , Secretary of State Hay made a bold move to acquire China ’s vast markets for American access by introducing Open Door notes , a series of circular notes that Hay himself drafted as an expression of U.S. interests in the region and sent to the other competing powers ( [ link ] ) .",1
12142,"These notes , if agreed to by the other five nations maintaining spheres of influences in China , would erase all spheres and essentially open all doors to free trade , with no special tariffs or transportation controls that would give unfair advantages to one country over another .",0
12143,"When William Howard Taft became president in 1909 , he chose to adapt Roosevelt ’s foreign policy philosophy to one that reflected American economic power at the time .",0
12144,"In what became known as “ dollar diplomacy , ” Taft announced his decision to “ substitute dollars for bullets ” in an effort to use foreign policy to secure markets and opportunities for American businessmen ( [ link ] ) .",1

12148,"The court ruled that during a time of war , the federal government was justified in passing such laws to quiet dissenters .",0
12149,"The decision was unanimous , and in the court ’s opinion , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that such dissent presented a “ clear and present danger ” to the safety of the United States and the military , and was therefore justified .",0
12150,"He further explained how the First Amendment right of free speech did not protect such dissent , in the same manner that a citizen could not be freely permitted to yell “ fire ! ” in a crowded theater , due to the danger it presented .",0
12151,"Prohibition , as the anti - alcohol movement became known , had been a goal of many Progressives for decades .",1
12152,"Organizations such as the Women ’s Christian Temperance Union and the Anti - Saloon League linked alcohol consumption with any number of societal problems , and they had worked tirelessly with municipalities and counties to limit or prohibit alcohol on a local scale .",0
12153,"But on the other side of the political spectrum , interventionists argued that Article X would impede the United States from using her rightfully attained military power to secure and protect America ’s international interests . Wilson ’s greatest fight was with the Senate , where most Republicans opposed the treaty due to the clauses surrounding the creation of the League of Nations .",0
12154,"Some Republicans , known as Irreconcilables , opposed the treaty on all grounds , whereas others , called Reservationists , would support the treaty if sufficient amendments were introduced that could eliminate Article X .",1
12155,"In an effort to turn public support into a weapon against those in opposition , Wilson embarked on a cross - country railway speaking tour .",0

12161,"Town leaders in Dayton , Tennessee , for their part , sensed an opportunity to promote their town , which had lost more than one - third of its population , and welcomed the ACLU to stage a test case against the Butler Act .",0
12162,"The ACLU and the town got their wish as the Scopes Monkey Trial , as the newspapers publicized it , quickly turned into a carnival that captured the attention of the country and epitomized the nation ’s urban / rural divide ( [ link ] ) .",0
12163,The new Negro found political expression in a political ideology that celebrated African Americans distinct national identity .,0
12164,"This Negro nationalism , as some referred to it , proposed that African Americans had a distinct and separate national heritage that should inspire pride and a sense of community .",1

12171,"To put this in context , a trading day of three million shares was considered a busy day on the stock market .",0
12172,Hoover believed strongly in the ethos of American individualism : that hard work brought its own rewards .,0
12173,His life story testified to that belief .,0
12174,"One of the most notable protest movements occurred toward the end of Hoover ’s presidency and centered on the Bonus Expeditionary Force , or Bonus Army , in the spring of 1932 .",0

12179,"As a result , the global depression worsened further .",0
12180,"A similar attempt to spur the world economy , known as the Hoover Moratorium , likewise met with great opposition and little economic benefit .",0

12186,"The law officially took the country off the gold standard , a restrictive practice that , although conservative and traditionally viewed as safe , severely limited the circulation of paper money .",1
12187,"The biggest threat to the president , however , came from corrupt but beloved Louisiana senator Huey “ Kingfish ” Long ( [ link ] ) .",0
12188,His disapproval of Roosevelt came in part from his own ambitions for higher office ; Long stated that the president was not doing enough to help people and proposed his own Share Our Wealth program .,0
12189,"With the implementation of the Second New Deal , Roosevelt also created the country ’s present - day social safety net .",0
12190,"The Social Security Act established programs intended to help the most vulnerable : the elderly , the unemployed , the disabled , and the young .",1

12200,"When the war began , the Department of War absorbed the program and adapted it to train combat pilots .",0
12201,"Still , there was some resistance to women going to work in such a male - dominated environment .",0
12202,"In order to recruit women for factory jobs , the government created a propaganda campaign centered on a now - iconic figure known as Rosie the Riveter ( [ link ] ) .",1
12203,"Rosie , who was a composite based on several real women , was most famously depicted by American illustrator Norman Rockwell .",0
12204,Japanese Americans also suffered from discrimination .,0
12205,"The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor unleashed a cascade of racist assumptions about Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans in the United States that culminated in the relocation and internment of 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry , 66 percent of whom had been born in the United States .",0

12219,Within the chorus of voices calling for integration and legal equality were many that more stridently demanded empowerment and thus supported Black Power .,0
12220,Black Power meant a variety of things .,0
12221,"Well before the end of the war , Congress had passed one of the most significant and far - reaching pieces of legislation to ease veterans’ transition into civilian life : the Servicemen ’s Readjustment Act , also known as the GI Bill ( [ link ] ) .",0
12222,"Every honorably discharged veteran who had seen active duty , but not necessarily combat , was eligible to receive a year ’s worth of unemployment compensation .",1
12223,"As a result of these conditions , Communism was making significant inroads in both Italy and France .",0

12225,"Between its implantation in April 1948 and its termination in 1951 , this program gave $ 13 billion in economic aid to European nations .",0

12233,"In fact , there were many alternative cultures .",0
12234,"Although Goldwater lost the 1964 election , his vigorous rejection of New Deal state and social legislation , along with his support of states’ rights , proved popular in the Deep South , which had resisted federal efforts at racial integration .",0
12235,"Taking a lesson from Goldwater ’s experience , Nixon also employed a southern strategy in 1968 .",0
12236,"Denouncing segregation and the denial of the vote to African Americans , he nevertheless maintained that southern states be allowed to pursue racial equality at their own pace and criticized forced integration .",0
12237,"Continuing his strategy of pitting one Communist nation against another , in May 1972 , Nixon made another newsworthy trip , traveling to Moscow to meet with the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev .",0

12244,"While many suffered , others prospered .",0
12245,"The 1970s had been the era of the hippie , and Newsweek magazine declared 1984 to be the “ year of the Yuppie . ” Yuppies , whose name derived from “ ( y)oung , ( u)rban ( p)rofessionals , ” were akin to hippies in being young people whose interests , values , and lifestyle influenced American culture , economy , and politics , just as the hippies’ credo had done in the late 1960s and 1970s .",1
12246,"Unlike hippies , however , yuppies were materialistic and obsessed with image , comfort , and economic prosperity .",0
12247,Concern over a decline in the country ’s moral values welled up on both sides of the political aisle .,0
12248,"In 1985 , anxiety over the messages of the music industry led to the founding of the Parents Music Resource Center ( PMRC ) , a bipartisan group formed by the wives of prominent Washington politicians including Susan Baker , the wife of Reagan ’s treasury secretary , James Baker , and Tipper Gore , the wife of then - senator Al Gore , who later became vice president under Bill Clinton .",1

12250,"In addition to reviving the economy and reducing the size of the federal government , Ronald Reagan also wished to restore American stature in the world .",0
12251,"He entered the White House a “ cold warrior ” and referred to the Soviet Union in a 1983 speech as an “ evil empire . ” Dedicated to upholding even authoritarian governments in foreign countries to keep them safe from Soviet influence , he was also desperate to put to rest Vietnam Syndrome , the reluctance to use military force in foreign countries for fear of embarrassing defeat , which had influenced U.S. foreign policy since the mid-1970s .",1

12255,"Clinton ’s victory was partly due to a significant gender gap between the parties , with women tending to favor Democratic candidates .",0

12259,"This speech encapsulated what became known as the Bush Doctrine , the belief that the United States has the right to protect itself from terrorist acts by engaging in pre - emptive wars or ousting hostile governments in favor of friendly , preferably democratic , regimes .",1
12260,"The more militant side won , and the argument for war was gradually laid out for the American people .",0
12261,"The immediate impetus to the invasion , it argued , was the fear that Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction ( WMDs ) : nuclear , chemical , or biological weapons capable of wreaking great havoc .",1
12262,"Hussein had in fact used WMDs against Iranian forces during his war with Iran in the 1980s , and against the Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988—a time when the United States actively supported the Iraqi dictator .",0
12263,The second proposed solution was to give students the opportunity to attend schools with better performance records .,0
12264,"Some of these might be charter schools , institutions funded by local tax monies in much the same way as public schools , but able to accept private donations and exempt from some of the rules public schools must follow .",1

12266,"Once they had purchased the loans , larger investment banks bundled them into huge packages known as collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) and sold them to investors around the world .",0

12268,"In the 1990s , the idea of legal , same - sex marriage seemed particularly unlikely ; neither of the two main political parties expressed support for it .",0
12269,"Things began to change , however , following Vermont ’s decision to allow same - sex couples to form state - recognized civil unions in which they could enjoy all the legal rights and privileges of marriage .",0

12275,"Instead , the Republican Party nominated a three - time governor from Ohio , Rutherford B. Hayes .",0
12276,"Hayes was a popular candidate who advocated for both “ hard money ” — an economy based upon gold currency transactions — to protect against inflationary pressures and civil service reform , that is , recruitment based upon merit and qualifications , which was to replace the practice of handing out government jobs as “ spoils . ” Most importantly , he had no significant political scandals in his past , unlike his predecessor Grant , who suffered through the Crédit Mobilier of America scandal .",1
12277,"In this most notorious example of Gilded Age corruption , several congressmen accepted cash and stock bribes in return for appropriating inflated federal funds for the construction of the transcontinental railroad .",0
12278,"Long supporting former President Grant , Conkling had no sympathy for some of Hayes’ early appeals for civil service reform .",0
12279,"The other was James G. Blaine , Republican senator from Maine and leader of the Half - Breeds .",0

12285,A group of journalists and writers collectively known as muckrakers provided an important spark that ignited the Progressive movement .,0
12286,"Unlike the “ yellow journalists ” who were interested only in sensationalized articles designed to sell newspapers , muckrakers exposed problems in American society and urged the public to identify solutions .",1
12287,"This shift , they believed , would ultimately lead to a system of government that was better able to address the needs of its citizens .",0
12288,Grassroots Progressives pushed forward their agenda of direct democracy through the passage of three state - level reforms .,0
12289,"At the state level , perhaps the greatest advocate of Progressive government was Robert La Follette ( [ link ] ) .",0
12290,"During his time as governor , from 1901 through 1906 , La Follette introduced the Wisconsin Idea , wherein he hired experts to research and advise him in drafting legislation to improve conditions in his state .",1
12291,"“ Fighting Bob ” supported numerous Progressive ideas while governor : He signed into law the first workman ’s compensation system , approved a minimum wage law , developed a progressive tax law , adopted the direct election of U.S. senators before the subsequent constitutional amendment made it mandatory , and advocated for women ’s suffrage .",0
12292,"Although Debs established a tenuous relationship with Samuel Gompers and the American Federation of Labor , some within the Socialist Party favored a more radical political stance than Debs ’s craft union structure .",0
12293,"As a result , William “ Big Bill ” Haywood formed the more radical IWW , or Wobblies , in 1905 .",0
12294,"Although he remained an active member of the Socialist Party until 1919 , Haywood appreciated the outcry of the more radical arm of the party that desired an industrial union approach to labor organization .",0
12295,"In a speech delivered at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta in 1895 , which was meant to promote the economy of a “ New South , ” Washington proposed what came to be known as the Atlanta Compromise ( [ link ] ) .",0
12296,"Speaking to a racially mixed audience , Washington called upon African Americans to work diligently for their own uplift and prosperity rather than preoccupy themselves with political and civil rights .",0
12297,Roosevelt won his second term in 1904 with an overwhelming 57 percent of the popular vote .,0
12298,"After the election , he moved quickly to enact his own brand of Progressivism , which he called a Square Deal for the American people .",0
12299,"Early in his second term , Roosevelt read muckraker Upton Sinclair ’s 1905 novel and exposé on the meatpacking industry , The Jungle .",1
12300,"In their campaigns , Roosevelt and Wilson formulated competing Progressive platforms .",0
12301,"Wilson described his more moderate approach as one of New Freedom , which stood for a smaller federal government to protect public interests from the evils associated with big businesses and banks .",1
12302,"Roosevelt campaigned on the promise of New Nationalism , a charge that he said required a vigorous and powerful federal government to protect public interests .",1
12303,"Lottie remained in China through famines , the Boxer Rebellion , and other hardships .",0
12304,"She fought against foot binding , a cultural tradition where girls’ feet were tightly bound to keep them from growing , and shared her personal food and money when those around her were suffering .",1
12305,"The difference in this uprising , however , was that supporters saw in the renewed U.S. Navy a force that could be a strong ally for Cuba .",0
12306,"Additionally , the late 1890s saw the height of yellow journalism , in which newspapers such as the New York Journal , led by William Randolph Hearst , and the New York World , published by Joseph Pulitzer , competed for readership with sensationalistic stories .",1
12307,"These publishers , and many others who printed news stories for maximum drama and effect , knew that war would provide sensational copy .",0
12308,"In 1898 , Russia obtained permission to build a railroad across northeastern Manchuria .",0
12309,"One by one , each country carved out their own sphere of influence , where they could control markets through tariffs and transportation , and thus ensure their share of the Chinese market .",0
12310,"Roosevelt articulated this seeming double standard in a 1904 address before Congress , in a speech that became known as the Roosevelt Corollary .",0
12311,"The Roosevelt Corollary was based on the original Monroe Doctrine of the early nineteenth century , which warned European nations of the consequences of their interference in the Caribbean .",1
12312,"Despite the loss of American lives on the Lusitania , President Wilson stuck to his path of neutrality in Europe ’s escalating war : in part out of moral principle , in part as a matter of practical necessity , and in part for political reasons .",0
12313,"Few Americans wished to participate in the devastating battles that ravaged Europe , and Wilson did not want to risk losing his reelection by ordering an unpopular military intervention .",0
12314,"The Wilson administration created the Committee of Public Information under director George Creel , a former journalist , just days after the United States declared war on Germany .",0
12315,"Creel employed artists , speakers , writers , and filmmakers to develop a propaganda machine .",0
12316,"Some troops saw combat , however , and were commended for serving with valor .",0
12317,"The 369th Infantry , for example , known as the Harlem Hellfighters , served on the frontline of France for six months , longer than any other American unit .",1
12318,One hundred seventy - one men from that regiment received the Legion of Merit for meritorious service in combat .,0
12319,"Referring to what became known as the Fourteen Points , Wilson called for openness in all matters of diplomacy and trade , specifically , free trade , freedom of the seas , an end to secret treaties and negotiations , promotion of self - determination of all nations , and more .",1
12320,"In addition , he called for the creation of a League of Nations to promote the new world order and preserve territorial integrity through open discussions in place of intimidation and war .",1
12321,"While illness , economic hardship , and racial tensions all came from within , another destabilizing factor arrived from overseas .",0
12322,"As revolutionary rhetoric emanating from Bolshevik Russia intensified in 1918 and 1919 , a Red Scare erupted in the United States over fear that Communist infiltrators sought to overthrow the American government as part of an international revolution ( [ link ] ) .",1
12323,"When investigators uncovered a collection of thirty - six letter bombs at a New York City post office , with recipients that included several federal , state , and local public officials , as well as industrial leaders such as John D. Rockefeller , fears grew significantly .",0
12324,"The assembly line helped Ford reduce labor costs within the production process by moving the product from one team of workers to the next , each of them completing a step so simple they had to be , in Ford ’s words , “ no smarter than an ox ” ( [ link ] ) .",0
12325,"Ford ’s reliance on the moving assembly line , scientific management , and time - motion studies added to his emphasis on efficiency over craftsmanship .",0
12326,But they also participated in more expressly Klan activities like burning crosses and the public denunciation of Catholics and Jews ( [ link ] ) .,0
12327,"By 1924 , this Second Ku Klux Klan had six million members in the South , West , and , particularly , the Midwest — more Americans than there were in the nation ’s labor unions at the time .",0
12328,"While the organization publicly abstained from violence , its member continued to employ intimidation , violence , and terrorism against its victims , particularly in the South .",0
12329,"Rebellious American youth , in particular , adjusted to the changes by embracing a new morality that was far more permissive than the social mores of their parents .",0
12330,"Many young women of the era shed their mother ’s morality and adopted the dress and mannerisms of a flapper , the Jazz Age female stereotype , seeking the endless party .",1
12331,"Flappers wore shorter skirts , shorter hair , and more makeup , and they drank and smoked with the boys ( [ link ] ) .",0
12332,"World War I , fundamentalism , and the Red Scare — a pervasive American fear of Communist infiltrators prompted by the success of the Bolshevik Revolution — all left their mark on these intellectuals .",1
12333,"Known as the Lost Generation , writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald , Ernest Hemingway , Sinclair Lewis , Edith Wharton , and John Dos Passos expressed their hopelessness and despair by skewering the middle class in their work .",0
12334,"They felt alienated from society , so they tried to escape ( some literally ) to criticize it .",0
12335,"From 1920 to 1923 , Secretary of the Interior Albert B .",0
12336,Fall was involved in a scam that became known as the Teapot Dome scandal .,0
12337,"Fall had leased navy reserves in Teapot Dome , Wyoming , and two other sites in California to private oil companies without opening the bidding to other companies .",1
12338,"Several banks , including deposit institutions that originally avoided investment loans , began to offer easy credit , allowing people to invest , even when they lacked the money to do so .",0
12339,"An example of this mindset was the Florida land boom of the 1920s : Real estate developers touted Florida as a tropical paradise and investors went all in , buying land they had never seen with money they did n’t have and selling it for even higher prices .",1
12340,This increase took place in spite of the twenty - six states that passed a variety of laws to prohibit the employment of married women .,0
12341,"Several women found employment in the emerging pink collar occupations , viewed as traditional women ’s work , including jobs as telephone operators , social workers , and secretaries .",1
12342,"Others took jobs as maids and housecleaners , working for those fortunate few who had maintained their wealth .",0
12343,"Among their demands , the association sought a federal government plan to set agricultural prices artificially high enough to cover the farmers’ costs , as well as a government commitment to sell any farm surpluses on the world market .",0
12344,"To achieve their goals , the group called for farm holidays , during which farmers would neither sell their produce nor purchase any other goods until the government met their demands .",1
12345,"However , the greatest strength of the association came from the unexpected and seldom - planned actions of its members , which included barricading roads into markets , attacking nonmember farmers , and destroying their produce .",0
12346,"Dust storms roiled through the Great Plains , creating huge , choking clouds that piled up in doorways and filtered into homes through closed windows .",0
12347,"Even more quickly than it had boomed , the land of agricultural opportunity went bust , due to widespread overproduction and overuse of the land , as well as to the harsh weather conditions that followed , resulting in the creation of the Dust Bowl ( [ link]).The dust storms that blew through the Great Plains were epic in scale .",0
12348,Drifts of dirt piled up against doors and windows .,0
12349,"Additionally , he outlined with Secretary of State Henry Stimson the Hoover - Stimson Doctrine , which announced that the United States would never recognize claims to territories seized by force ( a direct response to the recent Japanese invasion of Manchuria).Other diplomatic overtures met with less success for Hoover .",1
12350,"Most notably , in an effort to support the American economy during the early stages of the Depression , the president signed into law the Smoot - Hawley Tariff in 1930 .",0
12351,"The law , which raised tariffs on thousands of imports , was intended to increase sales of American - made goods , but predictably angered foreign trade partners who in turn raised their tariffs on American imports , thus shrinking international trade and closing additional markets to desperate American manufacturers .",1
12352,"Roosevelt understood the need to “ save the patient , ” to borrow a medical phrase he often employed , as well as to “ cure the ill . ” This meant both creating jobs , through such programs as the Works Progress Administration , which provided employment to over eight million Americans ( [ link ] ) , as well as reconfiguring the structure of the American economy .",1
12353,"In pursuit of these two goals , Americans re - elected Roosevelt for three additional terms in the White House and became full partners in the reshaping of their country .",0
12354,"Any ideas that Roosevelt held almost did not come to fruition , thanks to a would - be assassin ’s bullet .",0
12355,"On February 15 , 1933 , after delivering a speech from his open car in Miami ’s Bayfront Park , local Italian bricklayer Giuseppe Zangara emerged from a crowd of well - wishers to fire six shots from his revolver .",0
12356,"Although Roosevelt emerged from the assassination attempt unscathed , Zangara wounded five individuals that day , including Chicago Mayor Tony Cermak , who attended the speech in the hopes of resolving any long - standing differences with the president - elect .",0
12357,"In June 1933 , Roosevelt replaced the Emergency Banking Act with the more permanent Glass - Steagall Banking Act .",0
12358,"This law prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking , therefore stopping the practice of banks speculating in the stock market with deposits .",1
12359,"Large farms often cut production by laying off sharecroppers or evicting tenant farmers , making the program even worse for them than for small farm owners .",0
12360,"Their frustration led to the creation of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union ( STFU ) , an interracial organization that sought to gain government relief for these most disenfranchised of farmers .",1
12361,"The STFU organized , protested , and won its members some wage increases through the mid-1930s , but the overall plight of these workers remained dismal .",0
12362,"Employing several thousand Americans on a project that Roosevelt envisioned as a template for future regional redevelopment , the TVA revitalized a river valley that landowners had badly over - farmed , leaving behind eroded soil that lacked essential nutrients for future farming .",0
12363,"Under the direction of David Lilienthal , beginning in 1933 , the TVA workers erected a series of dams to harness the Tennessee River in the creation of much - needed hydroelectric power .",0
12364,"The arrival of both electric lighting and machinery to the region eased the lives of the people who lived there , as well as encouraged industrial growth .",0
12365,"In 1935 , Congress also passed the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act , which authorized the single largest expenditure at that time in the country ’s history : $ 4.8 billion .",0
12366,"Almost one - third of those funds were invested in a new relief agency , the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) .",0
12367,"Harry Hopkins , formerly head of the CWA , took on the WPA and ran it until 1943 .",0
12368,"Believing it to be his moment of strongest public support , Roosevelt chose to exact a measure of revenge against the U.S. Supreme Court for challenging his programs and to pressure them against challenging his more recent Second New Deal provisions .",0
12369,"To this end , Roosevelt created the informally named “ Supreme Court Packing Plan ” and tried to pack the court in his favor by expanding the number of justices and adding new ones who supported his views .",0
12370,His plan was to add one justice for every current justice over the age of seventy who refused to step down .,0
12371,"In addition , the Four Power Treaty , signed by the United States , Great Britain , France , and Japan in 1921 , committed the signatories to eschewing any territorial expansion in Asia .",1
12372,"In 1928 , the United States and fourteen other nations signed the Kellogg - Briand Pact , declaring war an international crime .",1
12373,Despite hopes that such agreements would lead to a more peaceful world — far more nations signed on to the agreement in later years — they failed because none of them committed any of the nations to take action in the event of treaty violations .,0
12374,"Responding to the German invasion of Poland , Roosevelt worked with Congress to alter the Neutrality Laws to permit a policy of “ Cash and Carry ” in munitions for Britain and France .",0
12375,"The legislation , passed and signed by Roosevelt in November 1939 , permitted belligerents to purchase war materiel if they could pay cash for it and arrange for its transportation on board their own ships .",1
12376,Millions of Americans purchased more than $ 185 billion worth of war bonds .,0
12377,Children purchased Victory Stamps and exchanged full stamp booklets for bonds .,0
12378,The federal government also instituted the current tax - withholding system to ensure collection of taxes .,0
12379,"Forced by racial discrimination to live in the barrios of East Los Angeles , many Mexican American youths sought to create their own identity and began to adopt a distinctive style of dress known as zoot suits , which were also popular among many young African American men .",0
12380,"The zoot suits , which required large amounts of cloth to produce , violated wartime regulations that restricted the amount of cloth that could be used in civilian garments .",0
12381,"In 1941 , although Roosevelt had yet to meet Soviet premier Joseph Stalin , he had confidence that he could forge a positive relationship with him , a confidence that Churchill believed was born of naiveté .",0
12382,"These allied leaders , known as the Big Three , thrown together by the necessity to defeat common enemies , took steps towards working in concert despite their differences .",0
12383,"Albert Einstein , who had emigrated to the United States in 1933 to escape the Nazis , urged President Roosevelt to launch an American atomic research project , and Roosevelt agreed to do so , with reservations .",1
12384,"In late 1941 , the program received its code name : the Manhattan Project .",0
12385,"Located at Los Alamos , New Mexico , the Manhattan Project ultimately employed 150,000 people and cost some $ 2 billion .",0
12386,"One of these was the Alliance for Progress , which collaborated with the governments of Latin American countries to promote economic growth and social stability in nations whose populations might find themselves drawn to communism .",1
12387,"Kennedy also established the Agency for International Development to oversee the distribution of foreign aid , and he founded the Peace Corps , which recruited idealistic young people to undertake humanitarian projects in Asia , Africa , and Latin America .",1
12388,"He hoped that by augmenting the food supply and improving healthcare and education , the U.S. government could encourage developing nations to align themselves with the United States and reject Soviet or Chinese overtures .",0
12389,"On October 22 , Kennedy demanded that Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev remove the missiles .",0
12390,He also ordered a naval quarantine placed around Cuba to prevent Soviet ships from approaching .,0
12391,"Despite his use of the word “ quarantine ” instead of “ blockade , ” for a blockade was considered an act of war , a potential war with the Soviet Union was nevertheless on the president ’s mind .",0
12392,"On November 27 , 1963 , a few days after taking the oath of office , President Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress and vowed to accomplish the goals that John F. Kennedy had set and to expand the role of the federal government in securing economic opportunity and civil rights for all .",0
12393,"Johnson brought to his presidency a vision of a Great Society in which everyone could share in the opportunities for a better life that the United States offered , and in which the words “ liberty and justice for all ” would have real meaning .",0
12394,Baker pushed for a “ participatory Democracy ” that built on the grassroots campaigns of active citizens instead of deferring to the leadership of educated elites and experts .,1
12395,"As a result of her actions , in April 1960 , the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) formed to carry the battle forward .",0
12396,"Within a year , more than one hundred cities had desegregated at least some public accommodations in response to student - led demonstrations .",0
12397,Black Power was also part of a much larger process of cultural change .,0
12398,The 1960s composed a decade not only of Black Power but also of Black Pride .,0
12399,"African American abolitionist John S. Rock had coined the phrase “ Black Is Beautiful ” in 1858 , but in the 1960s , it became an important part of efforts within the African American community to raise self - esteem and encourage pride in African ancestry .",0
12400,"Wartime price controls were retained for some items but removed from others , like meat .",0
12401,"In his 1949 inaugural address , Truman referred to his programs as the “ Fair Deal , ” a nod to his predecessor ’s New Deal .",0
12402,He wanted the Fair Deal to include Americans of color and became the first president to address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) .,0
12403,He advised that the best way to thwart Soviet plans for the world was to contain Soviet influence — primarily through economic policy — to those places where it already existed and prevent its political expansion into new areas .,1
12404,"This strategy , which came to be known as the policy of containment , formed the basis for U.S. foreign policy and military decision making for more than thirty years .",0
12405,The British aided the authoritarian government of Greece in its battles against Greek Communists .,0
12406,"In March 1947 , Great Britain announced that it could no longer afford the cost of supporting government military activities and withdrew from participation in the Greek civil war .",0
12407,"Stepping into this power vacuum , the United States announced the Truman Doctrine , which offered support to Greece and Turkey in the form of financial assistance , weaponry , and troops to help train their militaries and bolster their governments against Communism .",1
12408,"He strove to balance the federal budget , which appealed to conservative Republicans , but retained much of the New Deal and even expanded Social Security .",0
12409,"He maintained high levels of defense spending but , in his farewell speech in 1961 , warned about the growth of the military - industrial complex , the matrix of relationships between officials in the Department of Defense and executives in the defense industry who all benefited from increases in defense spending .",1
12410,"He disliked the tactics of Joseph McCarthy but did not oppose him directly , preferring to remain above the fray .",0
12411,"However , the United States often feared that the Soviets were making greater strides in developing technology with potential military applications .",0
12412,"This was especially true following the Soviet Union ’s launch of Sputnik ( [ link ] ) , the first manmade satellite , in October 1957 .",1
12413,"In September 1958 , Congress passed the National Defense Education Act , which pumped over $ 775 million into educational programs over four years , especially those programs that focused on math and science .",1
12414,"In the post - World War II period , marriage rates rose ; the average age at first marriage dropped to twenty - three for men and twenty for women .",0
12415,"Between 1946 and 1964 , married couples also gave birth to the largest generation in U.S. history to date ; this baby boom resulted in the cohort known as the baby boomers .",0
12416,Conformity also required that the wives of both working- and middle - class men stay home and raise children instead of working for wages outside the home .,0
12417,The challenge now was to integrate schools .,0
12418,"A year later , the U.S. Supreme Court ordered southern school systems to begin desegregation “ with all deliberate speed . ” Some school districts voluntarily integrated their schools .",0
12419,"For many other districts , however , “ deliberate speed ” was very , very slow .",0
12420,The political divisions that plagued the United States in the 1960s were reflected in the rise of identity politics in the 1970s .,0
12421,"As people lost hope of reuniting as a society with common interests and goals , many focused on issues of significance to the subgroups to which they belonged , based on culture , ethnicity , sexual orientation , gender , and religion .",1
12422,The ultimate political goal of the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) was the passage of an Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) .,0
12423,"The amendment passed Congress in March 1972 , and was sent to the states for ratification with a deadline of seven years for passage ; if the amendment was not ratified by thirty - eight states by 1979 , it would die .",0
12424,"The third group , composed of Catholics , African Americans and other minorities , and some of the young , antiwar element , galvanized around Robert Kennedy ( [ link ] ) .",0
12425,"Finally , there were the southern Democrats , the Dixiecrats , who opposed the advances made by the civil rights movement .",0
12426,Some found themselves attracted to the Republican candidate Richard Nixon .,0
12427,"The situation was made worse in October 1973 , when Syria and Egypt jointly attacked Israel to recover territory that had been lost in 1967 , starting the Yom Kippur War .",1
12428,"The Soviet Union significantly aided its allies , Egypt and Syria , and the United States supported Israel , earning the enmity of Arab nations .",0
12429,Just as influential as antiwar protests and campus violence in turning people against the war was the publication of documents the media dubbed the Pentagon Papers in June 1971 .,0
12430,These were excerpts from a study prepared during the Johnson administration that revealed the true nature of the conflict in Vietnam .,1
12431,"Nixon , however , refused to hand the tapes over and cited executive privilege , the right of the president to refuse certain subpoenas .",0
12432,"When he offered to supply summaries of the conversations , Cox refused .",0
12433,Reagan ’s primary goal upon taking office was to stimulate the sagging economy while simultaneously cutting both government programs and taxes .,1
12434,"His economic policies , called Reaganomics by the press , were based on a theory called supply - side economics , about which many economists were skeptical .",0
12435,"Influenced by economist Arthur Laffer of the University of Southern California , Reagan cut income taxes for those at the top of the economic ladder , which was supposed to motivate the rich to invest in businesses , factories , and the stock market in anticipation of high returns .",0
12436,"Among the strongest supporters of Ronald Reagan ’s campaign for president were members of the Religious Right , including Christian groups like the Moral Majority , 61 percent of whom voted for him .",0
12437,"By 1980 , evangelical Christians had become an important political and social force in the United States ( [ link ] ) .",0
12438,"Crack cocaine , a smokable type of cocaine popular with poorer addicts , was hitting the streets in the 1980s , frightening middle - class Americans .",1
12439,Reagan and other conservatives led a campaign to “ get tough on crime ” and promised the nation a “ war on drugs . ” Initiatives like the “ Just Say No ” campaign led by First Lady Nancy Reagan implied that drug addiction and drug - related crime reflected personal morality .,0
12440,Bush ’s refusal to gloat or declare victory helped him maintain the relationship with Gorbachev that Reagan had established .,0
12441,"In July 1991 , Gorbachev and Bush signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , or START , which committed their countries to reducing their nuclear arsenals by 25 percent .",1
12442,"A month later , attempting to stop the changes begun by Gorbachev ’s reforms , Communist Party hardliners tried to remove him from power .",0
12443,"To rally Republican opposition to Clinton and the Democrats , Newt Gingrich and Richard “ Dick ” Armey , two of the leaders of the Republican minority in the House of Representatives , prepared a document entitled Contract with America , signed by all but two of the Republican representatives .",0
12444,It listed eight specific legislative reforms or initiatives the Republicans would enact if they gained a majority in Congress in the 1994 midterm elections .,1
12445,"Shortly after takeoff on the morning of September 11 , 2001 , teams of hijackers from the Islamist terrorist group al - Qaeda seized control of four American airliners .",0
12446,Two of the airplanes were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan .,0
12447,"The Taliban refused to turn bin Laden over , and the United States began a bombing campaign in October , allying with the Afghan Northern Alliance , a coalition of tribal leaders opposed to the Taliban .",1
12448,U.S. air support was soon augmented by ground troops ( [ link ] ) .,0
12449,"First , it sought to hold schools accountable for raising standards and enabling students to meet them .",0
12450,"The No Child Left Behind Act , signed into law in January 2002 , erected a system of testing to measure and ultimately improve student performance in reading and math at all schools that received federal funds ( [ link ] ) .",1
12451,"Schools whose students performed poorly on the tests would be labeled “ in need of improvement . ” If poor performance continued , schools could face changes in curricula and teachers , or even the prospect of closure .",0
12452,"By 2008 , credit card debt had risen to over $ 1 trillion .",0
12453,"More importantly , banks were making high - risk , high - interest mortgage loans called subprime mortgages to consumers who often misunderstood their complex terms and lacked the ability to make the required payments .",1
12454,"International trade slowed , hurting many American businesses .",0
12455,"As the Great Recession of 2008 deepened , the situation of ordinary citizens became worse .",0
12456,"During the last four months of 2008 , one million American workers lost their jobs , and during 2009 , another three million found themselves out of work .",0
12457,"The act , which created the program known as Obamacare , represented the first significant overhaul of the American healthcare system since the passage of Medicaid in 1965 .",0
12458,"Its goals were to provide all Americans with access to affordable health insurance , to require that everyone in the United States acquire some form of health insurance , and to lower the costs of healthcare .",1
12459,"A series of decisions declared nine states’ prohibitions against same - sex marriage to be unconstitutional , and the Supreme Court rejected an attempt to overturn a federal court ruling to that effect in California in June 2013 .",0
12460,"Shortly thereafter , the Supreme Court also ruled that the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 was unconstitutional , because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .",0
12461,"At this time , the idea of liberty became an important concept .",0
12462,"According to John Locke , an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century , all people have natural rights to life , liberty , and property .",0
12463,From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed .,0
12464,"In socialist countries , the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity , transportation systems like airlines and railroads , and telecommunications systems .",0
12465,In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy : only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government .,1
12466,"For example , in China , the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party .",0
12467,"Thus , U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress , the president and vice president , members of state legislatures , governors , mayors , and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf .",0
12468,Most representative governments favor majority rule : the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority .,1
12469,"If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it , the law will be enacted .",0
12470,At the other end of the political spectrum are elite - driven forms of government .,0
12471,"In a monarchy , one ruler , usually a hereditary ruler , holds political power .",1
12472,"Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law , and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country , this is not always the case .",0
12473,This belief is called the elite theory of government .,0
12474,"In contrast to that perspective is the pluralist theory of government , which says that political power rests with competing interest groups who share influence in government .",1

12520,"Congress , it was decided , would consist of two chambers : the Senate and the House of Representatives .",1
12521,"The framers resolved this problem through a separation of powers , dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one , as shown in [ link ] .",0

12534,"Indeed , Hamilton asked rhetorically , would American citizens best be served by a representative “ whose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and his acquaintances ” or by someone with more extensive knowledge of the world ?",0
12535,"To those who argued that a merchant and land - owning elite would come to dominate Congress , Hamilton countered that the majority of men currently sitting in New York ’s state senate and assembly were landowners of moderate wealth and that artisans usually chose merchants , “ their natural patron[s ] and friend[s ] , ” to represent them .",0

12539,The Bill of Rights was intended to quiet the fears of Anti - Federalists that the Constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government .,0
12540,Many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the English Bill of Rights and the Virginia Declaration of Rights .,0
12541,"For example , the right to bear arms for protection ( Second Amendment ) , the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime ( Third Amendment ) , the right to a trial by jury ( Sixth and Seventh Amendments ) , and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment ( Eighth Amendment ) are taken from the English Bill of Rights .",1
12542,"The Fifth Amendment , which requires among other things that people can not be deprived of their life , liberty , or property except by a legal proceeding , was also greatly influenced by English law as well as the protections granted to Virginians in the Virginia Declaration of Rights .",1
12543,The Ninth and Tenth Amendments were intended to provide yet another assurance that people ’s rights would be protected and that the federal government would not become too powerful .,0
12544,The Ninth Amendment guarantees that liberties extend beyond those described in the preceding documents .,1
12545,"This was an important acknowledgment that the protected rights were extensive , and the government should not attempt to interfere with them .",0
12546,"For example , the Seventeenth Amendment , ratified in 1913 , gave voters the right to directly elect U.S. senators .",1
12547,"The Twentieth Amendment , which was ratified in 1933 during the Great Depression , moved the date of the presidential inauguration from March to January .",1
12548,"In a time of crisis , like a severe economic depression , the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected , and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation ’s capital quicker than before .",0
12549,The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States .,1
12550,The Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to African Americans and equal protection under the law regardless of race or color .,1
12551,"It also prohibited states from depriving their residents of life , liberty , or property without a legal proceeding .",0

12554,The Twenty - Fourth Amendment ( 1964 ) abolished the use of poll taxes .,1
12555,"Specifically , the federal design spelled out in the Constitution divides powers between two levels of government — the states and the federal government — and creates a mechanism for them to check and balance one another .",0
12556,"As an institutional design , federalism both safeguards state interests and creates a strong union led by a capable central government .",1
12557,The main advantage of this supermajority requirement is that no changes to the Constitution can occur unless there is broad support within Congress and among states .,0
12558,"The potential drawback is that numerous national amendment initiatives — such as the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) , which aims to guarantee equal rights regardless of sex — have failed because they can not garner sufficient consent among members of Congress or , in the case of the ERA , the states .",0
12559,"Before the late 1990s , the United Kingdom ’s unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power .",0
12560,"Since then , power has been gradually decentralized through a process of devolution , leading to the creation of regional governments in Scotland , Wales , and Northern Ireland as well as the delegation of specific responsibilities to them .",0
12561,"Other democratic countries with unitary systems , such as France , Japan , and Sweden , have followed a similar path of decentralization .",0
12562,"The last clause of Article I , Section 8 , commonly referred to as the elastic clause or the necessary and proper cause , enables Congress “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying ” out its constitutional responsibilities .",1

12568,"The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV asserts that states are prohibited from discriminating against out - of - staters by denying them such guarantees as access to courts , legal protection , property rights , and travel rights .",1
12569,The clause has not been interpreted to mean there can not be any difference in the way a state treats residents and non - residents .,0
12570,"As George Washington ’s secretary of the treasury from 1789 to 1795 , Alexander Hamilton championed legislative efforts to create a publicly chartered bank .",0
12571,"For Hamilton , the establishment of the Bank of the United States was fully within Congress ’s authority , and he hoped the bank would foster economic development , print and circulate paper money , and provide loans to the government .",1

12574,"However , the fiscal hardships that plagued the government during the War of 1812 , coupled with the fragility of the country ’s financial system , convinced Congress and then - president James Madison to create the Second Bank of the United States in 1816 .",0
12575,"Many states rejected the Second Bank , arguing that the national government was infringing upon the states’ constitutional jurisdiction .",0
12576,Defining the scope of national power was the subject of another landmark Supreme Court decision in 1824 .,0
12577,"In Gibbons v. Ogden , the court had to interpret the commerce clause of Article I , Section 8 ; specifically , it had to determine whether the federal government had the sole authority to regulate the licensing of steamboats operating between New York and New Jersey .

12580,Various states railed against the nationalization of power that had been going on since the late 1700s .,0
12581,"When President John Adams signed the Sedition Act in 1798 , which made it a crime to speak openly against the government , the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures passed resolutions declaring the act null on the grounds that they retained the discretion to follow national laws .",1
12582,"In effect , these resolutions articulated the legal reasoning underpinning the doctrine of nullification — that states had the right to reject national laws they deemed unconstitutional . W .",0
12583,"Led by John Calhoun , President Jackson ’s vice president , nullifiers argued that high tariffs on imported goods benefited northern manufacturing interests while disadvantaging economies in the South .",0
12584,South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification declaring both tariff acts null and void and threatened to leave the Union .,1
12585,"The federal government responded by enacting the Force Bill in 1833 , authorizing President Jackson to use military force against states that challenged federal tariff laws .",0
12586,The ultimate showdown between national and state authority came during the Civil War .,0
12587,"Prior to the conflict , in Dred Scott v. Sandford , the Supreme Court ruled that the national government lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories . Dred Scott v. Sandford , 60 U.S. 393 ( 1857 ) .",0
12588,But the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led eleven southern states to secede from the United States because they believed the new president would challenge the institution of slavery .,0
12589,"First , the Union victory put an end to the right of states to secede and to challenge legitimate national laws .",0
12590,"Second , Congress imposed several conditions for readmitting former Confederate states into the Union ; among them was ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments .",0

12622,"Not only did DOMA allow states to choose whether to recognize same - sex marriages , it also defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman , which meant that same - sex couples were denied various federal provisions and benefits — such as the right to file joint tax returns and receive Social Security survivor benefits .",1
12623,"Edith Windsor , the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case United States v.

12640,"We typically envision civil liberties as being limitations on government power , intended to protect freedoms that governments may not legally intrude on .",1
12641,"For example , the First Amendment denies the government the power to prohibit “ the free exercise ” of religion ; the states and the national government can not forbid people to follow a religion of their choice , even if politicians and judges think the religion is misguided , blasphemous , or otherwise inappropriate .",0

12645,"Particularly in times of war , or even in response to threats against national security , the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts , often without access to lawyers or a defense , seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial .",0
12646,"For example , during the Civil War , President Abraham Lincoln detained suspected Confederate saboteurs and sympathizers in Union - controlled states and attempted to have them tried in military courts , leading the Supreme Court to rule in Ex parte Milligan that the government could not bypass the civilian court system in states where it was operating .

12647,"84 , argued that the Constitution was “ merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation , ” rather than to concern itself with “ the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns . ” Hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous , because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such a list were not protected .",0
12648,"Later , James Madison , in his speech introducing the proposed amendments that would become the Bill of Rights , acknowledged another Federalist argument : “ It has been said , that a bill of rights is not necessary , because the establishment of this government has not repealed those declarations of rights which are added to the several state constitutions.”American History from Revolution to Reconstruction and Beyond , “ Madison Speech Proposing the Bill of Rights June 8 1789 , ” http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1786-1800/madison-speech-proposing-the-bill-of-rights-june-8-1789.php ( March 4 , 2016 ) .",0
12649,"For that matter , the Articles of Confederation had not included a specific listing of rights either .",0
12650,"Ultimately , James Madison delivered on this promise by proposing a package of amendments in the First Congress , drawing from the Declaration of Rights in the Virginia state constitution , suggestions from the ratification conventions , and other sources , which were extensively debated in both houses of Congress and ultimately proposed as twelve separate amendments for ratification by the states .",0

12655,"Legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years ; some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire Bill of Rights ( or at least the first eight amendments ) to the states , while others have argued that only some rights are extended .",0

12657,"More recently , Justice Clarence Thomas argued in the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago ruling that the individual right to bear arms applied to the states because of this clause . McDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742 ( 2010).The second provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that pertains to applying the Bill of Rights to the states is the due process clause , which says , “ nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . ” This provision is similar to the Fifth Amendment in that it also refers to “ due process , ” a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials ( or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process ) .",1
12658,"Although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically , the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states .",0
12659,We can broadly divide the provisions of the Bill of Rights into three categories .,0
12660,"The First , Second , Third , and Fourth Amendments protect basic individual freedoms ; the Fourth ( partly ) , Fifth , Sixth , Seventh , and Eighth protect people suspected or accused of criminal activity ; and the Ninth and Tenth , are consistent with the framers’ view that the Bill of Rights is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all the rights people have and guarantees a role for state as well as federal government ( [ link ] ) .",0
12661,"At the same time , public schooling was beginning to take root on a wide scale .",0
12662,"Since most states had traditional Protestant majorities and most state officials were Protestants themselves , the public school curriculum incorporated many Protestant features ; at times , these features would come into conflict with the beliefs of children from other Christian sects or from other religious traditions . The establishment clause today tends to be interpreted a bit more broadly than in the past ; it not only forbids the creation of a “ Church of the United States ” or “ Church of Ohio ” it also forbids the government from favoring one set of religious beliefs over others or favoring religion ( of any variety ) over non - religion .",0
12663,"Thus , the government can not promote , say , Islamic beliefs over Sikh beliefs or belief in God over atheism or agnosticism ( [ link ] ) .",0
12664,"The free exercise clause , on the other hand , limits the ability of the government to control or restrict religious practices .",1
12665,"This portion of the First Amendment regulates not the government ’s promotion of religion , but rather government suppression of religious beliefs and practices .",0
12666,"In the 1960s and 1970s , the court decided two cases in which it laid out a general test for deciding similar cases in the future .",0
12667,"In both Sherbert v. Verner , a case dealing with unemployment compensation , and Wisconsin v. Yoder , which dealt with the right of Amish parents to homeschool their children , the court said that for a law to be allowed to limit or burden a religious practice , the government must meet two criteria . Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 ( 1963 ) ; Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205 ( 1972 ) .",0
12668,"It must demonstrate both that it had a “ compelling governmental interest ” in limiting that practice and that the restriction was “ narrowly tailored . ” In other words , it must show there was a very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal .",1
12669,This standard became known as the Sherbert test .,0
12670,"But because it replaced the Sherbert test with one that allowed more government regulation of religious practices , followers of other religious traditions grew concerned that state and local laws , even ones neutral on their face , might be used to curtail their religious practices .",0
12671,"In 1993 , in response to this decision , Congress passed a law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) , which was followed in 2000 by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act after part of the RFRA was struck down by the Supreme Court .",0
12672,"In addition , since 1990 , twenty - one states have passed state RFRAs that include the Sherbert test in state law , and state court decisions in eleven states have enshrined the Sherbert test ’s compelling governmental interest interpretation of the free exercise clause into state law .

12673,Proponents of state RFRA laws argued that people and businesses ought not be compelled to endorse practices their religious beliefs held to be immoral or indecent and feared clergy might be compelled to officiate same - sex marriages against their religion ’s teachings .,0
12674,"Opponents of RFRA laws argued that individuals and businesses should be required , per Obergefell v. Hodges , to serve same - sex marriages on an equal basis as a matter of ensuring the civil rights of gays and lesbians , just as they would be obliged to cater or photograph an interracial marriage . Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2015 ) .",0
12675,"In the 1960s , however , the Supreme Court ’s rulings on free expression became more liberal , in response to the Vietnam War and the growing antiwar movement .",0
12676,"In a 1969 case involving the Ku Klux Klan , Brandenburg v. Ohio , the Supreme Court found that only speech or writing that constituted a direct call or plan to imminent lawless action , an illegal act in the immediate future , could be suppressed ; the mere advocacy of a hypothetical revolution was not enough . Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U.S. 444 ( 1969 ) .",1
12677,"The Supreme Court also found that various forms of symbolic speech — wearing clothing like an armband that carried a political symbol or raising a fist in the air , for example — were subject to the same protections as written and spoken communication .",0
12678,"This court decision was strongly criticized , and Congress responded by passing a federal law , the Flag Protection Act , intended to overrule it ; the act , too , was struck down as unconstitutional in 1990.United States v. Eichman , 496 U.S. 310 ( 1990 ) .",0

12689,"John Maynard Keynes ( 1883–1946 ) , one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century , pointed out that economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking .",0
12690,"Keynes , shown in [ link ] , famously wrote in the introduction to a fellow economist ’s book : “ [ Economics ] is a method rather than a doctrine , an apparatus of the mind , a technique of thinking , which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions . ” In other words , economics teaches you how to think , not what to think .",0
12691,"In a market economy , decision - making is decentralized .",0
12692,Market economies are based on private enterprise : the means of production ( resources and businesses ) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals .,1
12693,Businesses supply goods and services based on demand .,0
12694,"It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2013 , according to an entity known as The World Bank .",0

12701,"Thus , the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs , which are costs that were incurred in the past and can not be recovered , should not affect the current decision .",1
12702,"Productive efficiency means that , given the available inputs and technology , it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good .",1
12703,"All choices on the PPF in [ link ] , including A , B , C , D , and F , display productive efficiency .",0
12704,"When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country , we say that this country has a comparative advantage in that good .",1
12705,"In our example , Brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar cane and the U.S. has a comparative advantage in wheat .",0
12706,The first theme is scarcity .,0
12707,It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods .,0
12708,Both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or supplied .,0
12709,Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price .,1
12710,The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price .,1
12711,"The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary .",1
12712,"An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price .",1
12713,Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply .,1
12714,"Then , those values can be used to determine the price elasticity of demand : Price Elasticity of Demand=% change in quantity% change in price=–11.768=1.47Price Elasticity of Demand=% change in quantity% change in price=–11.768=1.47Therefore , the elasticity of demand from G to H 1.47 .",0
12715,The magnitude of the elasticity has increased ( in absolute value ) as we moved up along the demand curve from points A to B .,0
12716,Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45 .,0
12717,Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all .,1
12718,"In both cases , the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in [ link ] .",0
12719,"While perfectly elastic supply curves are unrealistic , goods with readily available inputs and whose production can be easily expanded will feature highly elastic supply curves .",0
12720,"However , in some cases , the price of a key input over which the firm has no control may rise .",0
12721,"For example , many chemical companies use petroleum as a key input , but they have no control over the world market price for crude oil .",0
12722,"Coffee shops use coffee as a key input , but they have no control over the world market price of coffee .",0
12723,"However , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers , because they are buying more steak instead , or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer .",0
12724,"When the income elasticity of demand is negative , the good is called an inferior good . The concepts of normal and inferior goods were introduced in Demand and Supply .",1
12725,"A higher level of income for a normal good causes a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good , which means that the income elasticity of demand is positive .",1
12726,"In markets for financial capital , the elasticity of savings — that is , the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates — will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial capital .",1
12727,That is :,0
12728,"Private enterprise , the ownership of businesses by private individuals , is a hallmark of the U.S. economy .",1
12729,"When people think of businesses , often giants like Wal - Mart , Microsoft , or General Motors come to mind .",0
12730,"These two definitions of cost are important for distinguishing between two conceptions of profit , accounting profit and economic profit .",0
12731,Accounting profit is a cash concept .,0
12732,It means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out .,1
12733,"However , the cost structure of all firms can be broken down into some common underlying patterns .",0
12734,"When a firm looks at its total costs of production in the short run , a useful starting point is to divide total costs into two categories : fixed costs that can not be changed in the short run and variable costs that can be changed . Fixed and Variable Costs",0
12735,"At some point , you may even see negative returns as the additional barbers begin bumping elbows and getting in each other ’s way .",0
12736,"In this case , the addition of still more barbers would actually cause output to decrease , as shown in the last row of [ link].This pattern of diminishing marginal returns is common in production .",0
12737,"As another example , consider the problem of irrigating a crop on a farmer ’s field .",0
12738,Marginal cost is somewhat different .,0
12739,Marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output .,1
12740,"So it is not the cost per unit of all units being produced , but only the next one ( or next few ) .",0
12741,"This pattern was illustrated earlier in [ link].In the middle portion of the long - run average cost curve , the flat portion of the curve around Q3 , economies of scale have been exhausted .",0
12742,"In this situation , allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average cost of production , and it is called constant returns to scale .",0
12743,"In this range of the LRAC curve , the average cost of production does not change much as scale rises or falls .",0
12744,"When the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up , for example , people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands , commuting by carpool or mass transit , or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home .",0
12745,Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand .,1
12746,The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand ( to be explained in the next module ) are held constant .,0
12747,"When economists talk about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price .",1
12748,Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service .,1
12749,"When the price of gasoline rises , for example , it encourages profit - seeking firms to take several actions : expand exploration for oil reserves ; drill for more oil ; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline ; build new oil refineries ; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations ; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours .",0
12750,Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied — that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied — the law of supply .,1
12751,The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply ( to be explained in the next module ) are held constant .,0
12752,"Remember this : When two lines on a diagram cross , this intersection usually means something .",0
12753,"The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium .",1
12754,"The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) .",1
12755,"In fact , at any above - equilibrium price , the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded .",1
12756,We call this an excess supply or a surplus .,0
12757,"A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two , and only two , variables : quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis .",0
12758,"The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing .",0
12759,"They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home , and so on .",0
12760,"A product whose demand falls when income rises , and vice versa , is called an inferior good .",1
12761,"In other words , when income increases , the demand curve shifts to the left .",0
12762,"Other goods are complements for each other , meaning that the goods are often used together , because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other .",1
12763,"Examples include breakfast cereal and milk ; notebooks and pens or pencils , golf balls and golf clubs ; gasoline and sport utility vehicles ; and the five - way combination of bacon , lettuce , tomato , mayonnaise , and bread .",0
12764,"In thinking about the factors that affect supply , remember what motivates firms : profits , which are the difference between revenues and costs .",1
12765,"Goods and services are produced using combinations of labor , materials , and machinery , or what we call inputs or factors of production .",1
12766,"If a firm faces lower costs of production , while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged , a firm ’s profits go up .",0
12767,How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events ?,0
12768,The answer lies in the ceteris paribus assumption .,0
12769,"Look at how each economic event affects each market , one event at a time , holding all else constant .",1
12770,Price controls come in two flavors .,0
12771,"A price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level ( the “ ceiling ” ) , while a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level ( the “ floor ” ) .",1
12772,This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings .,0
12773,"If nurses’ salaries in Minneapolis - St . Paul - Bloomington are higher than in other cities , more nurses will move to Minneapolis - St . Paul - Bloomington to find jobs , more people will be willing to train as nurses , and those currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full - time job .",0
12774,"In other words , there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the area . At equilibrium , the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal .",1
12775,"Thus , every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker , and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find a job .",0
12776,"The labor market , however , presents some prominent examples of price floors , which are often used as an attempt to increase the wages of low - paid workers .",0
12777,"The U.S. government sets a minimum wage , a price floor that makes it illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate .",1
12778,"In mid-2009 , the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $ 7.25 per hour .",0
12779,"Many states do have usury laws , which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge .",1
12780,"However , in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate .",0

12783,"José wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest utility , which is the term economists use to describe a person ’s level of satisfaction or happiness with his or her choices . Let ’s begin with an assumption , which will be discussed in more detail later , that José can measure his own utility with something called utils .",1
12784,"( It is important to note that you can not make comparisons between the utils of individuals ; if one person gets 20 utils from a cup of coffee and another gets 10 utils , this does not mean than the first person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as much . )",0
12785,Another way to look at this is by focusing on satisfaction per dollar .,0
12786,Marginal utility per dollar is the amount of additional utility José receives given the price of the product .,1
12787,"For José ’s T - shirts and movies , the marginal utility per dollar is shown in [ link ] .",0
12788,Let ’s begin with a concrete example illustrating how changes in income level affect consumer choices .,0
12789,[ link ] shows a budget constraint that represents Kimberly ’s choice between concert tickets at $ 50 each and getting away overnight to a bed - and - breakfast for $ 200 per night .,0
12790,"Kimberly has $ 1,000 per year to spend between these two choices .",0
12791,"A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline , while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline .",0
12792,"Goods where demand declines as income rises ( or conversely , where the demand rises as income falls ) are called “ inferior goods . ” An inferior good occurs when people trim back on a good as income rises , because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer .",1
12793,"For example , a higher - income household might eat fewer hamburgers or be less likely to buy a used car , and instead eat more steak and buy a new car .",0
12794,"Rates of saving in America have never been especially high , but they seem to have dipped even lower in recent years , as the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in [ link ] show .",0
12795,A decision about how much to save can be represented using an intertemporal budget constraint .,0
12796,Household decisions about the quantity of financial savings show the same underlying pattern of logic as the consumption choice decision and the labor - leisure decision .,0
12797,This insight suggests some skepticism about political proposals to encourage higher savings by providing savers with a higher rate of return .,0
12798,"For example , Individual Retirement Accounts ( IRAs ) and 401(k ) accounts are special savings accounts where the money going into the account is not taxed until it is taken out many years later , after retirement .",1
12799,"The main difference between these accounts is that an IRA is usually set up by an individual , while a 401(k ) needs to be set up through an employer .",0
12800,"Another area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting , or putting dollars in different mental categories where they take different values .",1
12801,"Economists typically consider dollars to be fungible , or having equal value to the individual , regardless of the situation .",0
12802,"You might , for instance , think of the $ 25 you found in the street differently from the $ 25 you earned from three hours working in a fast food restaurant .",0
12803,"A perfectly competitive firm is known as a price taker , because the pressure of competing firms forces them to accept the prevailing equilibrium price in the market .",1
12804,"If a firm in a perfectly competitive market raises the price of its product by so much as a penny , it will lose all of its sales to competitors .",0
12805,[ link ] presents the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in [ link ] .,0
12806,The marginal revenue curve shows the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit .,1
12807,"As mentioned before , a firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product — that is , the firm ’s demand curve is a horizontal line drawn at the market price level .",0
12808,"But in the long run , firms that are facing losses will shut down at least some of their output , and some firms will cease production altogether .",0
12809,The long - run process of reducing production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is called exit .,1
12810,"The following Clear It Up feature discusses where some of these losses might come from , and the reasons why some firms go out of business . Why do firms cease to exist ?",0
12811,"For a constant cost industry , whenever there is an increase in market demand and price , then the supply curve shifts to the right with new firms’ entry and stops at the point where the new long - run equilibrium intersects at the same market price as before .",1
12812,But why will costs remain the same ?,0
12813,"When profit - maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility - maximizing consumers , something remarkable happens : the resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both productive and allocative efficiency ( terms that were first introduced in ( Choice in a World of Scarcity ) .",0
12814,"Productive efficiency means producing without waste , so that the choice is on the production possibility frontier .",1
12815,"In the long run in a perfectly competitive market , because of the process of entry and exit , the price in the market is equal to the minimum of the long - run average cost curve .",0
12816,"These profits should attract vigorous competition as described in Perfect Competition , and yet , because of one particular characteristic of monopoly , they do not .",0
12817,"Barriers to entry are the legal , technological , or market forces that discourage or prevent potential competitors from entering a market .",1
12818,"Barriers to entry can range from the simple and easily surmountable , such as the cost of renting retail space , to the extremely restrictive .",0
12819,Economies of scale can combine with the size of the market to limit competition .,0

12821,"A copyright , according to the U.S .",0
12822,"Copyright Office , “ is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States for ‘ original works of authorship’ including literary , dramatic , musical , architectural , cartographic , choreographic , pantomimic , pictorial , graphic , sculptural , and audiovisual creations . ” No one can reproduce , display , or perform a copyrighted work without permission of the author .",1
12823,"AT&T lost its monopoly on long distance service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and satellite transmission , so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism .",0
12824,"The same thing happened to local service , especially in recent years , with the growth in cellular phone systems . The combination of improvements in production technologies and a general sense that the markets could provide services adequately led to a wave of deregulation , starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the 1990s .",0
12825,"This wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter , the prices that could be charged , and the quantities that could be produced in many industries , including telecommunications , airlines , trucking , banking , and electricity .",0
12826,"But a monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs , because it has had experience with such changes over time and because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience .",0
12827,A monopolist can use information on marginal revenue and marginal cost to seek out the profit - maximizing combination of quantity and price .,1
12828,Allocative efficiency is a social concept .,0
12829,"It refers to producing the optimal quantity of some output , the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more unit just equals the marginal cost .",1
12830,One type of imperfectly competitive market is called monopolistic competition .,0
12831,"Monopolistically competitive markets feature a large number of competing firms , but the products that they sell are not identical .",1
12832,"A firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways : physical aspects of the product , location from which the product is sold , intangible aspects of the product , and perceptions of the product .",1
12833,Products that are distinctive in one of these ways are called differentiated products .,0
12834,"As an example of a profit - maximizing monopolistic competitor , consider the Authentic Chinese Pizza store , which serves pizza with cheese , sweet and sour sauce , and your choice of vegetables and meats .",0
12835,"Although Authentic Chinese Pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and restaurants , it has a differentiated product .",0
12836,"As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits , new competitors will continue to enter the market , reducing the original firm ’s demand and marginal revenue curves .",0
12837,"The long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point Y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve .",1
12838,"When price is equal to average cost , economic profits are zero .",0
12839,Critics of market - oriented economies argue that society does not really need dozens of different athletic shoes or breakfast cereals or automobiles .,0
12840,"They argue that much of the cost of creating such a high degree of product differentiation , and then of advertising and marketing this differentiation , is socially wasteful — that is , most people would be just as happy with a smaller range of differentiated products produced and sold at a lower price .",0
12841,"Defenders of a market - oriented economy respond that if people do not want to buy differentiated products or highly advertised brand names , no one is forcing them to do so .",0
12842,Quantity demanded in the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the minimum of the average cost curve — which means that the market would have room for only two or three oligopoly firms ( and they need not produce differentiated products ) .,0
12843,"Again , smaller firms would have higher average costs and be unable to compete , while additional large firms would produce such a high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at a profitable price .",0
12844,"In the United States , as well as many other countries , it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is anti - competitive behavior , which is a violation of antitrust law .",0
12845,Both the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have responsibilities for preventing collusion in the United States .,0
12846,The prisoner ’s dilemma is a scenario in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from pursuing self - interest .,1
12847,It applies well to oligopoly .,0
12848,"If a group of U.S. companies signed such a contract , however , it would be illegal .",0
12849,"Certain international organizations , like the nations that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , have signed international agreements to act like a monopoly , hold down output , and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil exports .",0
12850,"Such agreements , however , because they fall in a gray area of international law , are not legally enforceable .",0
12851,"Thus , if oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel , but do not match price increases , then none of the oligopolists will have a strong incentive to change prices , since the potential gains are minimal .",0
12852,"This strategy can work like a silent form of cooperation , in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down output , increase price , and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement .",0
12853,"The laws that give government the power to block certain mergers , and even in some cases to break up large firms into smaller ones , are called antitrust laws .",1
12854,"Before a large merger happens , the antitrust regulators at the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice can allow the merger , prohibit it , or allow it if certain conditions are met .",0
12855,"Also in 1914 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair .",1
12856,"In 1950 , the Celler - Kefauver Act extended the Clayton Act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers .",0
12857,"In the twenty - first century , the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to enforce antitrust laws .",0
12858,Another approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these two cases is called the Herfindahl - Hirschman Index ( HHI ) .,0
12859,"The HHI , as it is often called , is calculated by summing the squares of the market share of each firm in the industry , as the following Work it Out shows .",1
12860,"For more on the difficulties of defining markets , refer to Monopoly . This new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies , instead of defining a market and counting up total sales .",0
12861,A common starting point is for antitrust regulators to use statistical tools and real - world evidence to estimate the demand curves and supply curves faced by the firms that are proposing the merger .,0
12862,A second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific industry .,0
12863,An exclusive dealing agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer can be legal or illegal .,0
12864,It is legal if the purpose of the contract is to encourage competition between dealers .,0
12865,"Computer software manufacturers may often bundle together a number of different programs , even when the buyer wants only a few of the programs .",0
12866,"Think about the software that is included in a new computer purchase , for example . Recall from the chapter on Monopoly that predatory pricing occurs when the existing firm ( or firms ) reacts to a new firm by dropping prices very low , until the new firm is driven out of the market , at which point the existing firm raises prices again .",0
12867,This pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring the entry of new firms into the market .,0
12868,So what then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly ?,0
12869,"[ link ] illustrates the case of natural monopoly , with a market demand curve that cuts through the downward - sloping portion of the average cost curve .",0
12870,"Points A , B , C , and F illustrate four of the main choices for regulation .",0
12871,"Thus , in the 1980s and 1990s , some regulators of public utilities began to use price cap regulation , where the regulator sets a price that the firm can charge over the next few years .",1
12872,A common pattern was to require a price that declined slightly over time .,0
12873,"A number of major accounting scandals involving prominent corporations such as Enron , Tyco International , and WorldCom led to the Sarbanes - Oxley Act in 2002 .",0
12874,Sarbanes - Oxley was designed to increase confidence in financial information provided by public corporations to protect investors from accounting fraud .,1
12875,"In this case , the sellers and buyers of concert tickets may both be quite satisfied with their voluntary exchange , but you have no voice in their market transaction .",0
12876,The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an externality .,1
12877,"Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive .",0
12878,"If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality .",0
12879,"If you love country music , then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a positive externality .",0
12880,"Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator , but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution .",0
12881,"If the firm is required to pay $ 100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator , production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ 100 .",0
12882,"In 1970 , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) was created to oversee all environmental laws .",1
12883,"In the same year , the Clean Air Act was enacted to address air pollution .",1
12884,"Just two years later , in 1972 , Congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching Clean Water Act .",0
12885,[ link ] illustrates the marginal costs that a firm faces in reducing pollution .,0
12886,"The marginal cost of pollution reduction , like most most marginal cost curves increases with output , at least in the short run .",0
12887,Reducing the first 10 pounds of particulate emissions costs the firm $ 300 .,0
12888,"Coase pointed out that this issue can not be resolved until property rights are clearly defined — that is , the legal rights of ownership on which others are not allowed to infringe without paying compensation .",1
12889,Does the farmer have a property right not to have a field burned ?,0
12890,[ link ] illustrates a theoretical model of this situation .,0
12891,"When the quantity of environmental protection is low so that pollution is extensive — for example , at quantity Qa — there are usually a lot of relatively cheap and easy ways to reduce pollution , and the marginal benefits of doing so are quite high .",0
12892,"At Qa , it makes sense to allocate more resources to fight pollution .",0
12893,"Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders , no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world .",0
12894,Global warming and biodiversity are examples of international externalities . Bringing the nations of the world together to address environmental issues requires a difficult set of negotiations between countries with different income levels and different sets of priorities .,0
12895,"If nations such as China , India , Brazil , Mexico , and others are developing their economies by burning vast amounts of fossil fuels or by stripping their forest and wildlife habitats , then the world ’s high - income countries acting alone will not be able to reduce greenhouse gases .",0
12896,"Economists do not have a great deal to say about the choice between P , Q , R , S and T in [ link ] , all of which lie along the production possibility frontier .",0
12897,"Countries with low per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) , such as China , place a greater emphasis on economic output — which in turn helps to produce nutrition , shelter , health , education , and desirable consumer goods .",0
12898,"Countries with higher income levels , where a greater share of people have access to the basic necessities of life , may be willing to place a relatively greater emphasis on environmental protection .",0
12899,Market competition can provide an incentive for discovering new technology because a firm can earn higher profits by finding a way to produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics consumers want .,0
12900,"As Gregory Lee , CEO of Samsung said , “ Relentless pursuit of new innovation is the key principle of our business and enables consumers to discover a world of possibilities with technology . ” An innovative firm knows that it will usually have a temporary edge over its competitors and thus an ability to earn above - normal profits before competitors can catch up .",0
12901,"If a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment , the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments .",0
12902,"However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits .",0
12903,"The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology .",1
12904,The social benefit of the drug takes into account the value of all the positive externalities of the drug .,1
12905,"If Big Drug were able to gain this social return instead of other companies , its demand for financial capital would shift to the demand curve DSocial , and it would be willing to borrow and invest $ 52 million .",0
12906,"However , if Big Drug is receiving only 50 cents of each dollar of social benefits , the firm will not spend as much on creating new products .",0
12907,"After all , positive externalities exist from investment in education .",0
12908,"While not always easy to measure , according to Walter McMahon , the positive externalities to education typically include better health outcomes for the population , lower levels of crime , a cleaner environment and a more stable , democratic government .",1
12909,"For these reasons , many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize primary , secondary , and higher education .",0
12910,State and federal governments support research in a variety of ways .,0
12911,"For example , United for Medical Research , a coalition of groups that seek funding for the National Institutes of Health , ( which is supported by federal grants ) , states : “ NIH - supported research added $ 69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million jobs in 2011 alone . ” The United States remains the leading sponsor of medical - related research spending $ 117 billion in 2011 .",1
12912,"Other institutions , such as the National Academy of Scientists and the National Academy of Engineers , receive federal grants for innovative projects .",0
12913,What about a situation where the positive externalities are so extensive that private firms could not expect to receive any of the social benefit ?,1
12914,This kind of good is called a public good .,0
12915,Spending on national defense is a good example of a public good .,0
12916,"When individuals make decisions about buying a public good , a free rider problem can arise , in which people have an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then to “ free ride ” on the purchases of others .",1
12917,They are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect .,0
12918,"Malpighian tubules are convoluted , which increases their surface area , and they are lined with microvilli for reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance .",1
12919,Malpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum .,0
12920,"Mammals , including humans , produce urea , whereas reptiles and many terrestrial invertebrates produce uric acid .",0
12921,Animals that secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste material are called ureotelic animals .,1
12922,Both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis .,0
12923,A neutrophil is also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens .,1
12924,"Neutrophils , shown in [ link ] , are the most abundant leukocytes of the immune system .",0
12925,T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes .,0
12926,"T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland , and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow .",1
12927,"NK cells identify intracellular infections , especially from viruses , by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class ( MHC ) I molecules on the surface of infected cells .",1
12928,Complement proteins perform several functions .,0
12929,"The proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to phagocytic cells , such as macrophages and B cells , and enhance engulfment ; this process is called opsonization .",1
12930,Certain complement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial cell membranes .,0
12931,An antigen is a foreign or “ non - self ” macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system .,1
12932,Not all antigens will provoke a response .,0
12933,Any individual may possess a population of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing virtually any infecting pathogen .,0
12934,"T and B cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens , called epitopes , presented by APCs , illustrated in [ link ] .",0
12935,"Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire antigen ; for this reason , epitopes are known as “ antigenic determinants . ” In the absence of information from APCs , T and B cells remain inactive , or naïve , and are unable to prepare an immune response .",0
12936,"When stimulated by the TH2 pathway , naïve B cells differentiate into antibody - secreting plasma cells .",0
12937,A plasma cell is an immune cell that secrets antibodies ; these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens .,1
12938,"Similar to T cells , naïve B cells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors ( BCRs ) , which are membrane - bound forms of Ig ( immunoglobulin , or an antibody ) .",1
12939,"Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue , which functions independently of the systemic immune system , and which has its own innate and adaptive components .",1
12940,"Mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) , illustrated in [ link ] , is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body .",1
12941,This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment .,0
12942,The combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead .,1
12943,"In addition to promoting immune tolerance of harmless antigens , other subsets of Treg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response , which is an inappropriate immune response to host cells or self - antigens .",0
12944,Another Treg class suppresses immune responses to harmful pathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis .,0
12945,"The term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined , multivalent structures ( such as IgM and IgA ) .",1
12946,"Although avidity measures the strength of binding , just as affinity does , the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure .",0
12947,"The renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , illustrated in [ link ] proceeds through several steps to produce angiotensin II , which acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume .",1
12948,Renin ( secreted by a part of the juxtaglomerular complex ) is produced by the granular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles .,1
12949,"It also triggers the release of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex , which in turn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb more sodium .",0
12950,"Angiotensin II also triggers the release of anti - diuretic hormone ( ADH ) from the hypothalamus , leading to water retention in the kidneys .",0
12951,It acts directly on the nephrons and decreases glomerular filtration rate .,0
12952,"Failures , insufficiencies , or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and replicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed .",0
12953,"Immunodeficiency is the failure , insufficiency , or delay in the response of the immune system , which may be acquired or inherited .",1
12954,"Immunodeficiency can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens ( such as HIV ) , chemical exposure ( including certain medical treatments ) , malnutrition , or possibly by extreme stress .",0
12955,Autoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population .,1
12956,Most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response .,0
12957,Fragmentation is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration .,1
12958,"If the animal is capable of fragmentation , and the part is big enough , a separate individual will regrow .",0
12959,"In viviparity the young develop within the female , receiving nourishment from the mother ’s blood through a placenta .",1
12960,The offspring develops in the female and is born alive .,0
12961,Semen is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions ( about 10 percent of the total ) and fluids from accessory glands that contribute most of the semen ’s volume .,1
12962,"Sperm are haploid cells , consisting of a flagellum as a tail , a neck that contains the cell ’s energy - producing mitochondria , and a head that contains the genetic material .",0
12963,"The walnut - shaped prostate gland surrounds the urethra , the connection to the urinary bladder .",1
12964,It has a series of short ducts that directly connect to the urethra .,0
12965,The clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse .,1
12966,The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva .,1
12967,The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male .,0
12968,"In both sexes , the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland .",1
12969,"When the reproductive hormone is required , the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) to the anterior pituitary .",0
12970,This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary into the blood .,0
12971,"In addition , estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles .",0
12972,"Estrogen is the reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth , ovulation , and calcium absorption ; it is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females .",1
12973,"These include breast development , flaring of the hips , and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation .",0
12974,"Just prior to the middle of the cycle ( approximately day 14 ) , the high level of estrogen causes FSH and especially LH to rise rapidly , then fall .",0
12975,"The spike in LH causes ovulation : the most mature follicle , like that shown in [ link ] , ruptures and releases its egg .",1
12976,The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost .,0
12977,"In mammals , the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida .",1
12978,"When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida , a series of biochemical events , called the acrosomal reactions , take place .",0
12979,"In placental mammals , the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane , as illustrated in [ link]b .",1
12980,"In mammals , the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development .",0
12981,"Here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers : the inner cell mass , and an outer layer called the trophoblast .",0
12982,Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual .,1
12983,"The length of time of gestation varies among animals , but is very similar among the great apes : human gestation is 266 days , while chimpanzee gestation is 237 days , a gorilla ’s is 257 days , and orangutan gestation is 260 days long .",0
12984,The fox has a 57-day gestation .,0
12985,The prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control .,1
12986,"Strictly speaking , contraception refers to preventing the sperm and egg from joining .",0
12987,"Both terms are , however , frequently used interchangeably .",0
12988,"The neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
12989,"In further development , the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord .",0
12990,A population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the same time .,1
12991,( Organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics . ),1
12992,"A population is identified , in part , by where it lives , and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries : natural boundaries might be rivers , mountains , or deserts , while examples of artificial boundaries include mowed grass , manmade structures , or roads .",0
12993,Many abiotic forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere .,0
12994,"The abiotic factors influence the distribution of biomes : large areas of land with similar climate , flora , and fauna .",0
12995,"There is little species diversity , low net primary productivity , and low aboveground biomass .",0
12996,The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost .,1
12997,"The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter , which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter .",0
12998,The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .,1
12999,"Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate ( approximately 200 m or 650 ft ) .",1
13000,"At depths greater than 200 m , light can not penetrate ; thus , this is referred to as the aphotic zone .",1
13001,The neritic zone ( [ link ] ) extends from the intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m ( or 650 ft ) at the edge of the continental shelf .,1
13002,"Since light can penetrate this depth , photosynthesis can occur in the neritic zone .",0
13003,"The deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone , which is at depths of 4000 m or greater .",1
13004,"The abyssal zone ( [ link ] ) is very cold and has very high pressure , high oxygen content , and low nutrient content .",0
13005,"Because of this , they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds .",0
13006,"When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus ( from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms , for example ) , the growth of algae skyrockets , resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom .",1
13007,Algal blooms ( [ link ] ) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water .,0
13008,Wetlands are different from lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth .,1
13009,"Emergent vegetation consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves , stems , and flowers extending above the water ’s surface .",1
13010,"There are several types of wetlands including marshes , swamps , bogs , mudflats , and salt marshes ( [ link ] ) .",0
13011,Climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one particular day in a biome or the colder - than - average temperatures that occurred on one day .,0
13012,"In contrast , weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time .",1
13013,Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour cycles .,0
13014,This occurred in 1783 when volcanos in Iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide .,0
13015,"This led to haze - effect cooling , a global phenomenon that occurs when dust , ash , or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result ; haze - effect cooling usually extends for one or more years .",1
13016,"In Europe and North America , haze - effect cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784 .",0
13017,Another source of methane is the melting of clathrates .,0
13018,Clathrates are frozen chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean .,1
13019,"When water warms , these chunks of ice melt and methane is released .",0
13020,"The study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist , and how closely associated they are with each other .",0
13021,"Within a particular habitat , a population can be characterized by its population size ( N ) , the total number of individuals , and its population density , the number of individuals within a specific area or volume .",0
13022,Population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations .,0
13023,"In addition to measuring simple density , further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the individuals .",0
13024,Species dispersion patterns ( or distribution patterns ) show the spatial relationship between members of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time .,1
13025,"In other words , they show whether members of the species live close together or far apart , and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart .",0
13026,"Furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , lowering the growth rate .",0
13027,"Therefore , when calculating the growth rate of a population , the death rate ( D ) ( number organisms that die during a particular time interval ) is subtracted from the birth rate ( B ) ( number organisms that are born during that interval ) .",1
13028,This is shown in the following formula :,0
13029,"In the real world , phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others .",0
13030,The resulting competition between population members of the same species for resources is termed intraspecific competition ( intra- = “ within ” ; -specific = “ species ” ) .,1
13031,Intraspecific competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity — resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need .,0
13032,"In Müllerian mimicry , multiple species share the same warning coloration , but all of them actually have defenses .",1
13033,[ link ] shows a variety of foul - tasting butterflies with similar coloration .,0
13034,A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it .,1
13035,"In this relationship , the parasite benefits , but the organism being fed upon , the host is harmed .",0
13036,"The area in question could be a habitat , a biome , or the entire biosphere .",0
13037,Species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat or biome .,1
13038,Species richness varies across the globe ( [ link ] ) .,0
13039,Keystone SpeciesA keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to upholding an ecological community ’s structure .,1
13040,"The intertidal sea star , Pisaster ochraceus , of the northwestern United States is a keystone species ( [ link ] ) .",1
13041,"On the Big Island , approximately 32 acres of land is added each year .",0
13042,"First , weathering and other natural forces break down the substrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements , known as pioneer species ( [ link ] ) .",1
13043,"These species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other , less hardy species will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species .",0
13044,Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus .,1
13045,Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes .,1
13046,The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new .,0
13047,Innate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli .,0
13048,"The simplest example of this is a reflex action , an involuntary and rapid response to stimulus .",1
13049,"To test the “ knee - jerk ” reflex , a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a rubber hammer .",0
13050,"A fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed , the pattern goes on to completion .",1
13051,"An example of such a behavior occurs in the three - spined stickleback , a small freshwater fish ( [ link ] ) .",0
13052,Communication within a SpeciesAnimals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals .,1
13053,"An example of this is seen in the three - spined stickleback , where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals females to mate .",0
13054,Distraction displays are seen in birds and some fish .,0
13055,They are designed to attract a predator away from the nest that contains their young .,1
13056,"In monogamous systems , one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season .",1
13057,"In some animals , such as the gray wolf , these associations can last much longer , even a lifetime .",0
13058,Habituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure .,1
13059,"This is a form of non - associative learning , as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward .",0
13060,"In classical conditioning , a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not been associated with , the conditioned stimulus .",1
13061,"The response to the original , unconditioned stimulus is called the unconditioned response .",1
13062,"A species’ life history describes the series of events over its lifetime , such as how resources are allocated for growth , maintenance , and reproduction .",1
13063,Life history traits affect the life table of an organism .,0
13064,"Single versus Multiple Reproductive EventsSome life history traits , such as fecundity , timing of reproduction , and parental care , can be grouped together into general strategies that are used by multiple species .",0
13065,Semelparity occurs when a species reproduces only once during its lifetime and then dies .,1
13066,"Such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event , sacrificing their health to the point that they do not survive .",0
13067,Nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways .,0
13068,"These are grouped into density - dependent factors , in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality , and density - independent factors , which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density .",1
13069,"Note that in the former , the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset .",0
13070,"Furthermore , the theory ignored the age - specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know is very important .",0
13071,New demographic - based models of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many ecological concepts included in r- and K - selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors .,0
13072,"In ecology , two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems : resistance and resilience .",0
13073,The ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance .,1
13074,"The speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed , called its resilience .",1
13075,There is a single path through the chain .,0
13076,Each organism in a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level .,1
13077,"Depending on their role as producers or consumers , species or groups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels .",0
13078,The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores : the primary consumers .,1
13079,Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers .,1
13080,Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .,1
13081,A holistic model — which accounts for all the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environment — is a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems .,1
13082,"A food web is a graphic representation of a holistic , non - linear web of primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics ( [ link ] ) .",1
13083,The study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment ( disturbances ) or by internal forces is called ecosystem dynamics .,1
13084,Ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies .,0
13085,"Three basic types of ecosystem modeling are routinely used in research and ecosystem management : a conceptual model , an analytical model , and a simulation model .",0
13086,A conceptual model is an ecosystem model that consists of flow charts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem .,1
13087,"A conceptual model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem ; however , its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited .",0
13088,"Chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available , such as in those associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean ( [ link ] ) .",1
13089,"Many chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy .",0
13090,"In this ecosystem , the total energy accumulated by the primary producers ( gross primary productivity ) was shown to be 20,810 kcal / m2/yr . Because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions ( like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss ) scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem .",0
13091,Net primary productivity is the energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms’ respiration and heat loss .,1
13092,The net productivity is then available to the primary consumers at the next trophic level .,0
13093,Net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level .,1
13094,"Assimilation is the biomass ( energy content generated per unit area ) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food , energy used for respiration , and energy lost as waste .",1
13095,Incomplete ingestion refers to the fact that some consumers eat only a part of their food .,1
13096,"Geologic processes , such as weathering , erosion , water drainage , and the subduction of the continental plates , all play a role in this recycling of materials .",0
13097,"Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process , the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle .",1
13098,Fossil fuels are considered a non - renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation .,0
13099,"A non - renewable resource , such as fossil fuel , is either regenerated very slowly or not at all .",1
13100,Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land ( including land beneath the surface of the ocean ) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems .,0
13101,"A dead zone is an area within a freshwater or marine ecosystem where large areas are depleted of their normal flora and fauna ; these zones can be caused by eutrophication , oil spills , dumping of toxic chemicals , and other human activities .",1
13102,"The number of dead zones has been increasing for several years , and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008 .",0
13103,"Traditionally , ecologists have measured biodiversity , a general term for the variety present in the biosphere , by taking into account both the number of species and their commonness .",1
13104,Biodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living things .,0
13105,Genetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts .,0
13106,Genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a species .,1
13107,"All of these species were found only in Lake Victoria ; therefore , the 500 species of cichlids were endemic .",0
13108,Endemic species are found in only one location .,1
13109,Endemics with highly restricted distributions are particularly vulnerable to extinction .,0
13110,"The Pleistocene Extinction is one of the lesser extinctions , and a recent one .",0
13111,"It is well known that the North American , and to some degree Eurasian , megafauna , or large animals , disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period .",0
13112,"The extinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of 10,000–12,000 years ago .",0
13113,Contemporary societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area .,0
13114,"Most plants produce secondary plant compounds , which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them , but some of which also work as medication .",1
13115,"For centuries in Europe , older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbals — books that identified plants and their uses .",0
13116,Exotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an ecosystem in which they did not evolve .,1
13117,Such introductions likely occur frequently as natural phenomena .,0
13118,The technology of molecular genetics and data processing and storage are maturing to the point where cataloguing the planet ’s species in an accessible way is close to feasible .,0
13119,"DNA barcoding is one molecular genetic method , which takes advantage of rapid evolution in a mitochondrial gene present in eukaryotes , excepting the plants , to identify species using the sequence of portions of the gene .",1
13120,Their excretory system consists of two tubules connected to a highly branched duct system .,0
13121,"The cells in the tubules are called flame cells ( or protonephridia ) because they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope , as illustrated in [ link]a .",1
13122,"The cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface ; cilia also draw water from the interstitial fluid , allowing for filtration .",0
13123,Animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water .,0
13124,Animals that excrete ammonia are said to be ammonotelic .,1
13125,Terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete nitrogenous wastes .,0
13126,The first two reactions occur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol .,0
13127,"Urea concentration in the blood , called blood urea nitrogen or BUN , is used as an indicator of kidney function .",1
13128,"The environment consists of numerous pathogens , which are agents , usually microorganisms , that cause diseases in their hosts .",1
13129,A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen .,1
13130,The innate immune system must respond accordingly : by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells that have already been infected .,0
13131,"When a pathogen enters the body , cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) on the pathogen ’s surface .",0
13132,"PAMPs are carbohydrate , polypeptide , and nucleic acid “ signatures ” that are expressed by viruses , bacteria , and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells .",1
13133,"The first cytokines to be produced are pro - inflammatory ; that is , they encourage inflammation , the localized redness , swelling , heat , and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection . The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen .",1
13134,"Neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens , such as bacteria and fungi .",0
13135,"A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules , such as histamine , in response to large pathogens .",1
13136,"A basophil is a leukocyte that , like a neutrophil , releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in [ link ] .",1
13137,"Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large , darkly staining nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in [ link ] .",1
13138,"Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer ( NK ) cells , lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells ( abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue ) .",1
13139,T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes .,0
13140,MHC II molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens ( “ non - self proteins ” ) and on lymphocytes .,0
13141,"MHC II molecules interact with helper T - cells to trigger the appropriate immune response , which may include the inflammatory response . Lymphocytes , such as NK cells , are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb Wright stain and therefore appear dark colored under a microscope .",1
13142,""""" >",0
13143,"An array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins , called a complement system , functions to destroy extracellular pathogens .",1
13144,Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously ; these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms .,0
13145,"In fact , without information from the innate immune system , the adaptive response could not be mobilized .",0
13146,"There are two types of adaptive responses : the cell - mediated immune response , which is carried out by T cells , and the humoral immune response , which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies .",0
13147,Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen .,0
13148,"Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC , where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells .",0
13149,"Dendritic cells are immune cells that process antigen material ; they are present in the skin ( Langerhans cells ) and the lining of the nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines .",1
13150,"Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response , thus functioning as an antigen - presenting cell .",0
13151,"Naïve CD4 + cells bind APCs via their antigen - embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T ( TH ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate B cells ( or cytotoxic T cells ) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat .",0
13152,"In contrast , CD8 + cells engage antigen - embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response .",0
13153,"The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune protection , but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors ( TCRs ) .",0
13154,"Plasma cells and CTLs are collectively called effector cells : they represent differentiated versions of their naïve counterparts , and they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells .",1
13155,"Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that APCs of the oral cavity , pharynx , and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter .",0
13156,"Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the liver , lymph nodes , small intestine , and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory T ( Treg ) cells , specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors .",1
13157,The combined result of Treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead .,0
13158,The majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes ( red blood cells ) .,1
13159,Lymph is a watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes .,1
13160,"Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems , which are separated by interstitial space , by a process called extravasation ( passing through to surrounding tissue ) .",0
13161,"Not all antibodies bind with the same strength , specificity , and stability .",0
13162,"In fact , antibodies exhibit different affinities ( attraction ) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules , as illustrated in [ link ] .",1
13163,"An antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably , and thus would be expected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding to the specific antigen .",0
13164,"Once the afferent arterioles are constricted , blood flow into the nephrons stops .",0
13165,These hormones go one step further and trigger the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system .,0
13166,"Renin acts on angiotensinogen , which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II .",1
13167,Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels .,0
13168,The atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) lowers blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator .,1
13169,It is released by cells in the atrium of the heart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep apnea .,0
13170,The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody - mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy .,1
13171,"In the United States , 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma , whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens .",0
13172,Both methods have advantages and disadvantages .,0
13173,Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent .,1
13174,A single individual can produce offspring asexually and large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly .,0
13175,BuddingBudding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region leading to a separation from the original organism into two individuals .,1
13176,Budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate animals such as corals and hydras .,0
13177,Hermaphroditism occurs in animals where one individual has both male and female reproductive parts .,1
13178,"Invertebrates such as earthworms , slugs , tapeworms and snails , shown in [ link ] , are often hermaphroditic .",0
13179,"In ovoviparity , fertilized eggs are retained in the female , but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg ’s yolk and the young are fully developed when they are hatched .",1
13180,"This occurs in some bony fish ( like the guppy Lebistes reticulatus ) , some sharks , some lizards , some snakes ( such as the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis ) , some vipers , and some invertebrate animals ( like the Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa ) .",0
13181,"Vertebrates have similar structures , with a few differences .",0
13182,"Non - mammals , such as birds and reptiles , have a common body opening , called a cloaca , for the digestive , excretory and reproductive systems .",1
13183,Coupling between birds usually involves positioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm .,0
13184,"Sperm mature in seminiferous tubules that are coiled inside the testes , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
13185,"The walls of the seminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells , with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the tubule and the fully developed sperm in the lumen .",0
13186,"The penis , illustrated in [ link ] , is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory organ during intercourse .",1
13187,The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ .,0
13188,"The mons pubis is a round , fatty area that overlies the pubic symphysis .",1
13189,The clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse .,1
13190,The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva .,1
13191,"Internal female reproductive structures include ovaries , oviducts , the uterus , and the vagina , shown in [ link ] .",0
13192,The pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments .,0
13193,Meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells .,1
13194,The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis .,1
13195,"At the onset of puberty , the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time .",0
13196,"FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback , as illustrated in [ link ] .",0
13197,LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood .,0
13198,"The ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs , while the menstrual cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining .",1
13199,"These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22–32 day cycle , with an average length of 28 days .",0
13200,"To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes , only one sperm must fuse with one egg .",0
13201,"In mammals , the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida .",1
13202,"When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida , a series of biochemical events , called the acrosomal reactions , take place .",0
13203,Cleavage can take place in two ways : holoblastic ( total ) cleavage or meroblastic ( partial ) cleavage .,0
13204,The type of cleavage depends on the amount of yolk in the eggs .,0
13205,"During the first two to four weeks of the first trimester , nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion .",0
13206,"As the trimester progresses , the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium , and the placenta forms .",0
13207,"This organ takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus , with the mother ’s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it .",1
13208,"Gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise , during further development , to the different organs in the animal body .",1
13209,This process is called organogenesis .,0
13210,Organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements of the cells within the embryo .,0
13211,Ecology is the study of the interactions of living organisms with their environment .,1
13212,One core goal of ecology is to understand the distribution and abundance of living things in the physical environment .,0
13213,"Ecosystem ecology is an extension of organismal , population , and community ecology .",0
13214,The ecosystem is composed of all the biotic components ( living things ) in an area along with the abiotic components ( non - living things ) of that area .,1
13215,"Some of the abiotic components include air , water , and soil .",0
13216,Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage .,0
13217,A layer of trees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper canopy — the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves .,1
13218,Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy .,0
13219,All of the ocean ’s open water is referred to as the pelagic realm ( or zone ) .,1
13220,The benthic realm ( or zone ) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor .,1
13221,"Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone , which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate ( approximately 200 m or 650 ft ) .",1
13222,"The intertidal zone , which is the zone between high and low tide , is the oceanic region that is closest to land ( [ link ] ) .",1
13223,"Generally , most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach .",0
13224,Phytoplankton and floating Sargassum ( a type of free - floating marine seaweed ) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone .,1
13225,"Zooplankton , protists , small fishes , and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world ’s fisheries . Beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone ( [ link ] ) .",1
13226,Within the oceanic zone there is thermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents .,0
13227,"Watch this National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) video to see marine ecologist Dr. Peter Etnoyer discusses his research on coral organisms . It is estimated that more than 4,000 fish species inhabit coral reefs .",0
13228,"These fishes can feed on coral , the cryptofauna ( invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs ) , or the seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral .",1
13229,"In addition , some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef ; these species include predators , herbivores , or planktivores .",0
13230,"Humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide aquatic resources for drinking water , crop irrigation , sanitation , and industry .",1
13231,These various roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services .,0
13232,"Lakes and ponds are found in terrestrial landscapes and are , therefore , connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these terrestrial biomes .",0
13233,"The source water is usually cold , low in nutrients , and clear .",0
13234,The channel ( the width of the river or stream ) is narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream .,1
13235,"Because of this , the current is often faster here than at any other point of the river or stream .",0
13236,"Climate refers to the long - term , predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area .",1
13237,The climate of a biome is characterized by having consistent temperature and annual rainfall ranges .,0
13238,The variation in the sun ’s intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change .,0
13239,Solar intensity is the amount of solar power or energy the sun emits in a given amount of time .,1
13240,There is a direct relationship between solar intensity and temperature .,0
13241,"For mobile organisms , such as mammals , birds , or fish , a technique called mark and recapture is often used .",0
13242,"This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way ( such as tags , bands , paint , or other body markings ) , and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population ; later , a new sample is collected , including some individuals that are marked ( recaptures ) and some individuals that are unmarked ( [ link ] ) .",1
13243,"Another tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve , which is a graph of the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time ( usually with data compiled from a life table ) .",1
13244,These curves allow us to compare the life histories of different populations ( [ link ] ) .,0
13245,"After 1 day and 24 of these cycles , the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion .",0
13246,"When the population size , N , is plotted over time , a J - shaped growth curve is produced ( [ link]).The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited .",0
13247,"Furthermore , some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce , lowering the growth rate .",0
13248,"Obviously , a bacterium can reproduce more rapidly and have a higher intrinsic rate of growth than a human .",0
13249,"The maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic potential , or rmax , thus changing the equation to :",0
13250,"While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration , other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten , even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals .",0
13251,"In Batesian mimicry , a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one .",1
13252,"Assuming they share the same predators , this coloration then protects the harmless ones , even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic .",0
13253,"All species have an ecological niche in the ecosystem , which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with other species in the community .",1
13254,The competitive exclusion principle states that two species can not occupy the same niche in a habitat .,1
13255,"In other words , different species can not coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources .",0
13256,"A second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism , where two species benefit from their interaction .",1
13257,Some scientists believe that these are the only true examples of symbiosis .,0
13258,Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time .,1
13259,"In primary succession , newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things ; in secondary succession , part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain .",1
13260,Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus .,1
13261,Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes .,1
13262,"One goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors , which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences , from the learned behaviors , which result from environmental conditioning .",1
13263,"Innate behavior , or instinct , is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned .",0
13264,"A similar , but more directed version of kinesis is taxis : the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus .",1
13265,"This movement can be in response to light ( phototaxis ) , chemical signals ( chemotaxis ) , or gravity ( geotaxis ) and can be directed toward ( positive ) or away ( negative ) from the source of the stimulus .",0
13266,Foraging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources .,1
13267,"Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors , and these are favored by natural section .",1
13268,"Significant energy is spent in the process of locating , attracting , and mating with the sex partner .",0
13269,"Two types of selection occur during this process and can lead to traits that are important to reproduction called secondary sexual characteristics : intersexual selection , the choosing of a mate where individuals of one sex choose mates of the other sex , and intrasexual selection , the competition for mates between species members of the same sex .",1
13270,"Intersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual , aural , tactile , and chemical cues .",0
13271,"In polyandrous mating systems , one female mates with many males .",1
13272,These types of systems are much rarer than monogamous and polygynous mating systems .,0
13273,"Conditioned behaviors are types of associative learning , where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence .",1
13274,"During operant conditioning , the behavioral response is modified by its consequences , with regards to its form , strength , or frequency .",1
13275,"Some primates , including humans , are able to learn by imitating the behavior of others and by taking instructions .",0
13276,"The development of complex language by humans has made cognitive learning , the manipulation of information using the mind , the most prominent method of human learning .",1
13277,"In fact , that is how students are learning right now by reading this book .",0
13278,Fecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population .,1
13279,"In other words , fecundity describes how many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible , repeating the reproductive cycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring .",0
13280,"Additionally , populations do not usually exist in isolation .",0
13281,"They engage in interspecific competition : that is , they share the environment with other species , competing with them for the same resources .",1
13282,These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow .,0
13283,"In contrast , r - selected species have a large number of small offspring ( hence their r designation ( [ link ] ) .",0
13284,This strategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments .,0
13285,The scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage .,0
13286,"In ecology , a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass : primary producers , primary consumers , and higher - level consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics .",1
13287,There is a single path through the chain .,0
13288,Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores .,1
13289,"Higher - level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels , and so on , up to the organisms at the top of the food chain : the apex consumers .",1
13290,"In the Lake Ontario food chain shown in [ link ] , the Chinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food chain .",0
13291,"A grazing food web ( such as the Lake Ontario food web in [ link ] ) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base , followed by herbivores and various carnivores .",1
13292,"A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter ( dead organisms ) , called decomposers or detritivores .",1
13293,These organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material back into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms .,0
13294,An analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .,1
13295,A simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics .,1
13296,"Ideally , these models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances , and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers ( such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists ) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health .",0
13297,One of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification .,0
13298,"Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of persistent , toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level , from the primary producers to the apex consumers .",1
13299,"Many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate , including classical studies with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) , which was published in the 1960s bestseller , Silent Spring , by Rachel Carson .",0
13300,"As rain falls through this gas , it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain .",0
13301,"Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas , turning it into weak sulfuric acid , which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems .",1
13302,"Acid rain damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes , which kills many of the resident fauna ; it also affects the man - made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings .",0
13303,"The Nile perch was introduced in 1963 , but lay low until the 1980s when its populations began to surge .",0
13304,"The Nile perch population grew by consuming cichlids , driving species after species to the point of extinction ( the disappearance of a species ) .",0
13305,"In fact , there were several factors that played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in Lake Victoria : the Nile perch , declining lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of Lake Victoria , and increased fishing pressure .",0
13306,"It is also useful to define ecosystem diversity , meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or in a given geographic area ( [ link ] ) .",1
13307,Whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other ecosystems .,0
13308,"In 1988 , British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at significant risk for species loss : biodiversity hotspots .",0
13309,Biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species .,1
13310,"The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts , a kind of conservation triage .",0
13311,A second approach to estimating present - time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest - area loss and understanding species - area relationships .,0
13312,The species - area relationship is the rate at which new species are seen when the area surveyed is increased .,1
13313,Studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island increases .,0
13314,View a brief video discussing the role of marine ecosystems in supporting human welfare and the decline of ocean ecosystems . Bush meat is the generic term used for wild animals killed for food .,1
13315,"Hunting is practiced throughout the world , but hunting practices , particularly in equatorial Africa and parts of Asia , are believed to threaten several species with extinction .",0
13316,"Early evidence suggests that another fungal pathogen , Geomyces destructans , introduced from Europe is responsible for white - nose syndrome , which infects cave - hibernating bats in eastern North America and has spread from a point of origin in western New York State ( [ link ] ) .",0
13317,"In order to describe the motion of an object , you must first be able to describe its position — where it is at any particular time .",1
13318,"More precisely , you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame .",0
13319,Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them .,0
13320,Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions .,1
13321,"Distance has no direction and , thus , no sign .",0
13322,"The motion of falling objects , as covered in Problem - Solving Basics for One - Dimensional Kinematics , is a simple one - dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement .",1
13323,"In this section , we consider two - dimensional projectile motion , such as that of a football or other object for which air resistance is negligible . The most important fact to remember here is that motions along perpendicular axes are independent and thus can be analyzed separately .",0
13324,"This fact was discussed in Kinematics in Two Dimensions : An Introduction , where vertical and horizontal motions were seen to be independent .",0
13325,"When adding velocities , we have been careful to specify that the velocity is relative to some reference frame .",1
